      Chromium Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
      <b>What you will find here is the original documentation for the Chromium
      project as of version 1.9. Use it judiciously, as several features
      are not part of the vmgl project. Hopefully, you'll feel inclined
      to contribute :)</b>

    <p>
      Chromium is a system for interactive rendering on clusters of
      workstations.&nbsp; It is a completely extensible architecture, so that
      parallel rendering algorithms can be implemented on clusters with
      ease.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Among Chromium's features are
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sort-first (tiled) rendering - the frame buffer is subdivided into
      rectangular tiles which may be rendered in parallel by the hosts of a
      rendering cluster.
      </li>
      <li>Sort-last (Z-compositing) rendering - the 3D dataset is broken into N
      parts which are rendered in parallel by N processors. The resulting
      images are composited together according to their Z buffers to form the
      final image.
      </li>
      <li>Hybrid parallel rendering - sort-first and sort-last rendering may be
      combined into a hybrid configuration.
      </li>
      <li>OpenGL command stream filtering - OpenGL command streams may be
      intercepted and modified by a stream processing unit (SPU) to implement
      non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) effects, etc. Here's an <a href=
      "http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/archsplit/" target=
      "_parent">interesting example</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Many OpenGL programs can be used with Chromium without modification.
      </li>
      <li>One can write Chromium-specific applications which perform parallel
      rendering with the aid of special synchronization primitives.
      </li>
      <li>Chromium runs on Linux, IRIX, AIX, SunOS and Windows-based systems.
      </li>
      <li>Chromium is an open-source project.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Chromium is derived from the <a href=
      "http://graphics.stanford.edu/software/wiregl" target=
      "_parent">WireGL</a> project. Even if you're completely happy with your
      WireGL setup, we recommend replacing it with Chromium for several
      reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Numerous bugs have been found and fixed since the last WireGL
      release.
      </li>
      <li>The new configuration system will make setting up and reconfiguring
      your tiled display much simpler.
      </li>
      <li>Chromium has many, many more features.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This documentation serves as both a reference guide and tutorial for
      using and extending Chromium. See the the <a href="help.html">Where to
      get help</a> link for other resources.

      Chromium is mainly the product of <a href=
      "http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~humper/" target="_parent">Greg
      Humphreys</a>.&nbsp; However, a few other individuals deserve special
      mention.&nbsp; <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~ianbuck/" target=
      "_parent">Ian Buck</a> wrote the original state tracking and bucketing
      system for WireGL, which the Chromium "tilesort" SPU and "state_tracker"
      library are loosely based on.&nbsp; Ian has also been in charge of the
      WireGL release process and maintenance for its 80+ users.&nbsp; <a href=
      "http://graphics.stanford.edu/~eldridge/" target="_parent">Matthew
      Eldridge</a> made significant improvements to WireGL's networking
      libraries and the overall system design, and his design philosophy (if
      not his code) lives on in Chromium.&nbsp; <a href=
      "http://www.ccntech.com/" target="_parent">Chris Niederauer</a> did most
      of the implementation of the OpenGL extensions, including all of the
      NVIDIA-specific ones.&nbsp; He also designed the Chromium logo and did a
      lot of really useful slave labor for us last summer when we were building
      our cluster.

      For the beta and 1.0 through 1.4 releases <a href=
      "mailto:brian.paul-no-spam@tungstengraphics.com" target="_parent">Brian
      Paul</a> and <a href="mailto:alanh@tungstengraphics.com" target=
      "_parent">Alan Hourihane</a> of Tungsten Graphics, Inc. contributed much
      of the development. Brian and <a href="mailto:alanm@redhat.com" target=
      "_parent">Alan Matsuoka (of Red Hat)</a> made many contributions to the
      Chromium 1.4 through 1.7 releases.
