<h1 class="PageHeading">How to Contribute to Chromium</h1>

<p>We welcome the
opportunity to make this system better and more universally applicable with the
help of you, the user.&nbsp; There are a number of ways that you can give back
to Chromium:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write new SPU's.&nbsp; Useful, interesting, or just plain cool SPU's can
    easily make it into the main tree.</li>
  <li>Support new networks.&nbsp; The networking model in Chromium is (we hope)
    stable enough that you could write a module to support a new networking
    type, using either the TCP/IP or Myrinet modules as a guide.</li>
  <li>Add support for new OpenGL functionality.&nbsp; Have a favorite
    extension?&nbsp; Take a look at the extensions we've already implemented and
    add some more.</li>
  <li>Combine existing SPU's (or new SPU's) in interesting ways.&nbsp;
    Descriptions of (and configuration files for) new kinds of things that can
    be done with Chromium networked node graphs are quite welcome.</li>
  <li>Port to a new operating system.&nbsp; Not everyone runs Windows or
    Linux.&nbsp; This should be fairly straightforward, and the build system
    will help you by hollering whenever it doesn't know how to do something.</li>
  <li>Add new kinds of functionality to existing SPU's.&nbsp; We're particularly
    interested in seeing off-axis projection support built into Chromium for
    supporting casual arrangements of projectors or CAVE's.&nbsp; We know that a
    couple of groups did this work for WireGL -- hopefully it should be easy to
    put it into the existing Chromium system.&nbsp; If it could be its own SPU,
    that would be ideal, but a modification to the TileSort SPU might make most
    sense.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chromium is an open source project hosted on
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/chromium">SourceForge.</a>
There, you can join the mailing lists and get involved with the other
Chromium users and developers.</p>

<p>If you have modifications or additions to Chromium that you would like
to see included in the official source tree, you should join the Chromium
developers mailing list and post your proposal.</p>

<p>Contributors which demonstrate a certain level of competence may be
given CVS-write permission so he or she can directly check-in code to
the project.</p>

<p>By making a contribution to Chromium it's assumed that you agree to
the terms of the license agreement (similar to the BSD/MIT/XFree86 license).
See the LICENSE.txt file for details.
</p>

<p>We hope that Chromium will eventually make a significant
difference in the way large-scale visualization problems are tackled.
User feedback and contributions will be critical to ensuring the
feature-completeness and robustness that will require.</p>
