      Automatic Start-up and Configuration
    </h1>
    <p>
      Normally, running a Chromium configuration involves starting the
      mothership then one or more server nodes (<span class=
      "CrApp">crserver</span>) and application nodes (<span class=
      "CrApp">crappfaker</span>). With the auto-start / auto-config feature you
      can simply run an OpenGL program normally and have it run on Chromium.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Auto-Start
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <code class="Function">node.AutoStart()</code> function allows you to
      execute an arbitrary shell command in order to spawn the Chromium
      crserver and <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span> programs. This saves
      you from having to manually starting the programs yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start, let's define two strings with some environment variables and
      the name of the program to run:
    </p>
    <pre class="GrayCodeListing2">
env = "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=" + crlibdir
prog = crbindir + "/crserver"
</pre>
    <p>
      Now, here's an example of how to autmatically start a crserver on a
      remote host named "mars" using rsh:
    </p>
    <pre class="GrayCodeListing2">
node.AutoStart( [ "/usr/bin/rsh", "mars",
                  "/bin/sh -c '" + env + " " + prog + "'" ] )
</pre>
    <p>
      Here's an example of how to autmatically start a crserver on the local
      host just using sh:
    </p>
    <pre class="GrayCodeListing2">
node.AutoStart( ["/bin/sh", "-c", env + " " + prog] )
</pre>
    <p>
      To start the <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span> instead of
      <span class="CrApp">crserver</span>, just change the <code>prog</code>
      assignment above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, the <span class="Function">AutoStart()</span> function takes a
      list of command line arguments which are passed to the Python
      <span class="Function">os.spawnv()</span> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use /bin/sh (the Bourne shell) to be sure that the environment
      variables will be interpreted correctly. You may have to do some
      tinkering to make things work correctly on your system. Some things to
      check:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Manually check that <span class="App">rsh</span> or <span class=
      "App">sh</span> works without having to type in a password.
      </li>
      <li>Check where <span class="App">sh</span> and <span class=
      "App">rsh</span> live in your filesystem and set the paths accordingly.
      </li>
      <li>Add extra environment vars as needed, such as <span class=
      "EnvVar">CRMOTHERSHIP</span>, if they're not set in your <span class=
      "File">.bashrc</span> file.
      </li>
      <li>To debug things, try typing the <span class="App">rsh</span> or
      <span class="App">sh</span> commands in a terminal window and see what
      happens (instead of using AutoStart right away).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Auto-Config
    </h2>
    <p>
      Auto-Config is a feature that automatically starts the mothership when
      you run an OpenGL program. In turn, the mothership can automatically
      start all the <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span> and <span class=
      "CrApp">crserver</span> processes (as described above). The end result is
      that users can run their OpenGL programs in the normal manner and
      automatically use Chromium.
    </p>
    <p>
      This example assumes that Chromium is located in <span class=
      "Directory">/usr/local/Chromium-x.y</span>. Adjust these instructions
      accordingly if you have Chromium installed elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following steps need to be taken:
    </p>
    <p class="StepList">
      1. (For Unix/Linux) Use libcrfaker.so instead of libGL.so
    </p>
    <p class="Indent">
      We have to trick the OpenGL application into using the crfaker library
      instead of the normal OpenGL library. One solution is to create symbolic
      links from libcrfaker.so to libGL.so and libGL.so.1 and then use
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH to tell the application where to find the library. For
      example:
    </p>
    <pre>
   cd /usr/local/Chromium-x.y/cr/lib/Linux
   ln -s libcrfaker.so libGL.so
   ln -s libcrfaker.so libGL.so.1
   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/Chromium-x.y/cr/lib/Linux
</pre>
    <p class="StepList">
      1. (For Microsoft Windows) Use <span class="File">libcrfaker.dll</span>
      instead of <span class="File">opengl32.dll</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Indent">
      We have to trick the OpenGL application into using the crfaker library
      instead of the normal OpenGL library. One solution is to copy the
      libcrfaker.dll to opengl32.dll and then use the PATH environment variable
      to tell the application where to find the library. This will ensure that
      the new opengl32.dll will be picked up before the system's version.
    </p>
    <pre>
   cd c:\Chromium-x.y\cr\bin\WIN_NT
   copy libcrfaker.dll opengl32.dll
   set PATH=c:\Chromium-x.y\cr\bin\WIN_NT;....
</pre>
    <p class="StepList">
      2. Make a configuration file
    </p>
    <p class="Indent">
      A good way to make a configuration file is with the graphical
      configuration tool. You might make, for example, a tilesort
      configuration.
    </p>
    <p class="Indent">
      Make sure your configuration:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sets the <em>Automatically Start Servers</em> option (from the
      Mothership / Options menu).
      </li>
      <li>Sets the <em>System GL Path</em> option for the <span class=
      "SPU">render</span> SPUs so that the real OpenGL library is found.
      </li>
      <li>Do not set the <em>Command</em> option for the application node (from
      the Node / App Node Options menu).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Indent">
      Save your configuration to a file such as <span class=
      "File">/usr/local/Chromium-x.y/cr/mothership/configs/myconfig.conf</span>
    </p>
    <p class="StepList">
      XXX -temporary
    </p>
    <p class="Indent">
      For the time being, you may have to edit your configuration file and
      specify the full path to the Chromium server's python directory:
    </p>
    <pre class="GrayCodeListing2">
   sys.path.append( "/usr/local/Chromium-x.y/cr/mothership/server" )
</pre>
    <p class="Indent">
      Otherwise, the configuration script may not be able to find the
      mothership.py file.
    </p>
    <p class="StepList">
      3. Set up the .crconfigs file
    </p>
    <p class="Indent">
      The <span class="File">.crconfigs</span> file is expected to be in your
      home directory (i.e. at <span class="File">/home/joe/.crconfigs</span>).
      If it's not found there, Chromium will look in the current directory when
      you start your application.
    </p>
    <p class="Indent">
      The <span class="File">.crconfigs</span> file maps program names to
      configuration names. Each line of the file is of the format:
    </p>
    <p class="Command">
      <em>program</em> <em>configuration</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an example:
    </p>
    <pre>
   atlantis  /usr/local/Chromium-x.y/cr/mothership/configs/myconfig.conf
   city      /usr/local/Chromium-x.y/cr/mothership/configs/tilecity.conf -r1 -c2
   *         /usr/local/Chromium-x.y/cr/mothership/configs/default.conf %p
</pre>
    <p class="Indent">
      This example specifies configuration files for the atlantis and city
      programs.
    </p>
    <p class="Indent">
      In the case of the city configuration, two optional command line
      arguments are given to the tilecity script to set the mural rows and
      columns.
    </p>
    <p class="Indent">
      The * (asterisk) entry denotes a default to use when there is no other
      match.
    </p>
    <p class="Indent">
      The %p sequence will be replaced by the program name.
      If %d is present, it will be replaced by the current working directory.
      if %m is present, it will be replaced by a a randomly chosen mothership
      port number.  The spawned mothership will listen on that port.
    </p>
    <p class="StepList">
      4. The CR_CONFIG_PATH and CR_CONFIG environment variables
    </p>
    <p class="Indent">
      If the <span class="EnvVar">CR_CONFIG_PATH</span> environment variable is
      set, it will provide an alternate file to look in for configuration. The
      file contents are identical to that in <span class=
      "File">.crconfigs</span>. It is merely an alternate way of specifying the
      location. Here's an example:
    </p>
    <p class="Command">
      setenv CR_CONFIG_PATH "/tmp/autostart.conf"
    </p>
    <p class="Indent">
      If the <span class="EnvVar">CR_CONFIG</span> environment variable is set,
      the <span class="File">.crconfigs</span> file is not processed and no
      matching for program names is done. Instead, the contents of the
      <span class="EnvVar">CR_CONFIG</span> variable are used instead to
      identify which mothership configuration file is to be used. The same
      syntax is used as for the <em>configuration</em> section of a line in the
      <span class="File">.crconfigs</span> file. Here's an example:
    </p>
    <p class="Command">
      setenv CR_CONFIG<br>
      "/usr/local/Chromium-x.y/cr/mothership/configs/tilecity.conf -r1 -c2"
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Run it!
    </h2>
    <p>
      At this point running a program, such as city, should cause everything to
      start automatically. Here's what happens:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The application (effectively linked to <span class=
      "File">libcrfaker.so</span> instead of <span class=
      "File">libGL.so</span>) will make a GLX call which initialized the faker
      library.
      </li>
      <li>The faker library will try to contact the mothership, and fail (since
      it's not running).
      </li>
      <li>The faker library will look for the <span class=
      "EnvVar">CR_CONFIG</span> environment variable or lookup the program name
      in the <span class="File">.crconfigs</span> file.
      </li>
      <li>The faker will now have the name of a configuration (possibly with
      command line arguments).
      </li>
      <li>The faker will try to spawn (fork/exec) the mothership, specifying
      the configuration and command line arguments.
      </li>
      <li>The mothership will start and create a thread that will spawn the
      crserver nodes. The servers will load their SPUs.
      </li>
      <li>The faker will contact the mothership and load its SPUs.
      </li>
      <li>Chromium will now be running.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Trouble shooting
    </h2>
    <p>
      Here are some things to check if this doesn't work:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>(Unix/Linux only) Run <span class="Command">ldd programname</span>
      and verify that you're linked against the faker library. You should see
      something like this:
        <p class="Indent">
          <span class="Output">libGL.so =&gt;
          /usr/local/Chromium-x.y/cr/lib/Linux/libGL.so (0x4010b000)</span>
        </p><span class=
        "File">/usr/local/Chromium-x.y/cr/lib/Linux/libGL.so</span> should be a
        symlink to <span class="File">libcrfaker.so</span>
      </li>
      <li>(Microsoft Windows only) Check that the '<span class=
      "App">python.exe</span>' application is within the system <span class=
      "EnvVar">PATH</span> if crSpawn fails. The easiest way to check this is
      open a '<span class="App">cmd</span>' prompt and type '<span class=
      "Command">python</span>' and hit return. If Python doesn't start - check
      your setup.
      </li>
      <li>Examine the output of the crfaker to see if your configuration is
      being found:
        <pre>
    CR Debug(foo:26248): Spawning mothership with argv:
    CR Debug(foo:26248): argv[0] = 'python'
    CR Debug(foo:26248): argv[1] = '/usr/local/Chromium-x.y/cr/mothership/tools/tilecity.conf'
    CR Debug(foo:26248): argv[2] = '-r1'
    CR Debug(foo:26248): argv[3] = '-c2'
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Check that your configuration file is able to find the <span class=
      "File">mothership.py</span> file; look for <code class=
      "Function">sys.path.append()</code> lines.
      </li>
      <li>If the render servers aren't starting, make sure the
      <code>auto_start</code> option is set.
      </li>
      <li>Make sure there aren't any other mothership instances already running
      by checking the output of running <span class="Command">ps -a</span> or
      <span class="Command">ps -e</span>.
      </li>
    </ul>
