      Writing a new SPU
    </h1>
    <p>
      This web page will step you through the creation of the "invert"
      SPU.&nbsp; This SPU will modify the OpenGL stream so that all of the
      colors are inverted.&nbsp; Although this is a toy example, it shows the
      power of Chromium's modularity, and can be used as a starting point for
      more complex SPUs.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Step 1: Creating the SPU directory
    </h2>
    <p>
      This step is very simple.&nbsp; Change to the <span class=
      "Directory">spu/</span> directory, and type the following commands:
    </p>
    <p class="Command">
      cp -r template invert<br>
      cd invert<br>
      python gen_template.py invert
    </p>
    <p>
      The first command will make a copy of the "template" SPU in a directory
      <span class="Directory">spu/invert/</span>.&nbsp; The <span class=
      "File">gen_template.py</span> script will rename all of the template
      files to be consistent with your chosen SPU name (in this case,
      "invert"), and it will also change all of the variable names and other
      identifiers in the C code and header files to be consistent with the new
      SPU name.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process will leave you with seven files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="File">Makefile</span>: A properly formed Makefile for
        Chromium's build system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="File">gen_template.py</span>: The script you just
        ran.&nbsp; You can delete it now; it will no longer be needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="File">invertspu.c</span>: This file contains the list of
        functions that the Invert SPU will implement.&nbsp; Currently that list
        is empty.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="File">invertspu.def</span>: A list of exported symbols for
        Windows.&nbsp; SPUs only ever export one function, and it's already
        listed in this file, so you should never have to change this.&nbsp; If
        you're not building on Windows, you <em>really</em> don't care about
        this file.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="File">invertspu.h</span>: A header file containing a
        global structure to represent the state of this SPU, as well as a
        couple of pre-defined function declarations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="File">invertspu_config.c</span>: Code to communicate with
        the mothership to gather configuration.&nbsp; Currently the code in
        this file just connects to the mothership and immediately quits.&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="File">invertspu_init.c</span>: Startup and initialization
        code for this SPU.&nbsp; These entry points will be called by the SPU
        loader before any application code is run, so they are the best place
        to contact the mothership (already implemented in the template),
        initialize any external resources or libraries that need initializing,
        etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Assuming that the rest of the Chromium system has been built already, you
      should be able to type "make" at this point, and the SPU should compile
      without warnings.&nbsp; If it doesn't, something is horribly wrong.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Step 2: Initialize the SPU
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the most part, this SPU initializes itself.&nbsp; However, there are
      two small changes to be made to the initialization routine.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, we must introduce the notion of <em>SPU inheritance</em>.&nbsp; A
      SPU need not implement the full OpenGL API.&nbsp; In fact, most SPUs will
      not.&nbsp; Instead, a SPU can implement a subset of the OpenGL API, and
      the remainder of the API can be obtained from a "SuperSPU".&nbsp; For
      example, a SPU that is designed to only accept calls to <code class=
      "Function">glDrawPixels</code> could get the rest of its API from the
      <span class="SPU">error</span> SPU, which will print an error message on
      any OpenGL function call.&nbsp; The <span class="SPU">error</span> SPU is
      in fact the default SuperSPU.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of the Invert SPU, we will inherit from the <span class=
      "SPU">passthrough</span> SPU, since we want to modify an OpenGL stream as
      it is made.&nbsp; To do this, edit the file <span class=
      "File">invertspu_init.c</span>.&nbsp; In the function <code class=
      "Function">SPULoad</code>, you will see the line:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      super = NULL;
    </p>
    <p>
      Change this line to:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      super = "passthrough";
    </p>
    <p>
      That's all there is to it.&nbsp; If you've been paying really close
      attention, you might think that we need to check to make sure this SPU is
      loaded with a child (i.e., it does not appear at the end of a SPU
      chain).&nbsp; This check is actually performed by the <span class=
      "SPU">passthrough</span> SPU when <em>it</em> is loaded, so another check
      would be redundant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice two other things about this initialization file, and in particular
      the function <code class="Function">SPUInit</code>:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>There is a global variable called <code>invert_spu</code> that holds
      all information pertaining to this instance of this SPU.
      </li>
      <li>A copy of the dispatch tables for the SPU's SuperSPU, and this SPU's
      child (i.e., the SPU following it in the chain) are stored in the <code>
        invert_spu</code> global variable.&nbsp; This is how we will pass
        functions through once we have modified their arguments.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You should still be able to compile the <span class="SPU">invert</span>
      SPU after this step.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Step 3: Tell the SPU which functions you're going to implement
    </h2>
    <p>
      Open the file <span class="File">invertspu.c</span>.&nbsp; You will see
      the following code at the bottom of the file:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      SPUNamedFunctionTable _cr_invert_table[] = {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ NULL, NULL }<br>
      };
    </p>
    <p>
      This table is a NULL-terminated list of&nbsp; <code>{ name, function
      }&nbsp;</code> pairs that will be parsed by the SPU loader to build a SPU
      dispatch table.&nbsp; Therefore, order does not matter.&nbsp; For this
      SPU, we will want to implement those functions that affect the
      color.&nbsp; There are actually a lot of them, so for the purposes of
      this example, we'll only implement a few: <code class=
      "Function">glColor3f</code>, <code class="Function">glClearColor</code>,
      and <code class="Function">glMaterialfv</code>.&nbsp; For this step, all
      we have to do is add these function names and pointers to our
      implementation in this list.&nbsp; Change the above code to:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      SPUNamedFunctionTable _cr_invert_table[] = {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ "Color3f",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      (SPUGenericFunction) invertColor3f },<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ "ClearColor", (SPUGenericFunction)
      invertClearColor },<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ "Materialfv", (SPUGenericFunction)
      invertMaterialfv },<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ NULL, NULL }<br>
      };
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice two things about this table:&nbsp; First, the function names on
      the left do not begin with "gl".&nbsp; Second, the functions on the right
      (which we haven't implemented yet) must be cast to "SPUGenericFunction"
      in order to properly build this table.&nbsp; This has the unfortunate
      side effect that you can easily get the number or type of arguments to a
      function wrong, and the compiler will not catch the error, so be careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this step, you will not be able to compile the SPU, because the
      functions <code class="Function">invertColor3f</code>, <code class=
      "Function">invertClearColor</code>, and <code class=
      "Function">invertMaterialfv</code> are not defined.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Step 4: Define the functions
    </h2>
    <p>
      We will implement the three needed functions at the top of the file
      <span class="File">invertspu.c</span>, since that's where they are
      referred to.&nbsp; In a larger SPU, it you would probably want to break
      these things into multiple files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately before the table you created in step 3, add the lines:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing">
      void INVERTSPU_APIENTRY invertColor3f( GLfloat red,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      GLfloat green,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      GLfloat blue )<br>
      {<br>
      }
    </p>
    <p>
      (We will fill in the body in a minute).&nbsp; The strange identifier
      "<code>INVERTSPU_APIENTRY</code>", defined in the header <span class=
      "File">invertspu.h</span>, is necessary to ensure correct operation on
      Windows.&nbsp; On Windows, it is defined to "<code>__stdcall</code>",
      which matches the calling conventions used by the system's OpenGL
      implementation.&nbsp; This is necessary since the OpenGL replacement DLL
      will simply <em>jump</em> to this function instead of calling it, so the
      calling conventions need to match those expected by the calling
      application.&nbsp; On non-Windows machines, this identifier has no
      effect.&nbsp; See the header file for the entire definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Important</b>: Every OpenGL replacement function needs to use this
      identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition of the other two functions is similarly straightforward:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      void INVERTSPU_APIENTRY invertClearColor( GLfloat red,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      GLfloat green,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      GLfloat blue,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      GLfloat alpha )<br>
      {<br>
      }
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      void INVERTSPU_APIENTRY invertMaterialfv( GLenum face,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      GLenum mode,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      const GLfloat *param )<br>
      {<br>
      }
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the SPU may still not compile at this point, because the unused
      variables may generate warnings (depending on your compiler), and the
      default Chromium build system configuration files (in <span class=
      "Directory">config/</span>) consider warnings to be errors.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Step 5: Write the function bodies
    </h2>
    <p>
      The final step in our SPU is to actually implement our filters.&nbsp;
      Let's look at the implementation of <code class=
      "Function">glColor3f</code> first.
    </p>
    <p>
      All we need to do is subtract the specified colors from unity before
      passing them to our child.&nbsp; Since our SuperSPU already handles
      passing parameters to a child SPU, all we need to do is call our
      SuperSPU's implementation of <code class="Function">Color3f</code> with
      modified arguments. Therefore, the full body for <code class=
      "Function">invertColor3f</code> should look like:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      void INVERTSPU_APIENTRY invertColor3f( GLfloat red,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      GLfloat green,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      GLfloat blue )<br>
      {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invert_spu.super.Color3f( 1-red, 1-green, 1-blue
      );<br>
      }
    </p>
    <p>
      That's all there is to it!&nbsp; Note that this would have been exactly
      equivalent to calling:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      invert_spu.child.Color3f( 1-red, 1-green, 1-blue );
    </p>
    <p>
      But I prefer calling the <span class="SPU">passthrough</span> SPU as a
      (marginally) cleaner design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The implementation of <code class="Function">invertMaterialfv</code> is
      slightly more interesting, because it needs to behave differently
      depending on what the "<code>mode</code>" parameter is.&nbsp; In
      particular, if <code>mode</code> is <code>GL_SHININESS</code>, there is
      only one parameter, and we shouldn't invert it.&nbsp; Otherwise, there
      are four parameters, and they should get inverted.&nbsp; To do this, we
      make a local array of four <code>float</code> variables, invert the
      provided parameters, and pass them to the SuperSPU. If the user specifies
      the material shininess, we leave the parameters alone and just dispatch
      them to the SuperSPU verbatim:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      void INVERTSPU_APIENTRY invertMaterialfv( GLenum face,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      GLenum mode,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      const GLfloat *param )<br>
      {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (mode != GL_SHININESS)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLfloat
      local_param[4];<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local_param[0] =
      1-param[0];<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local_param[1] =
      1-param[1];<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local_param[2] =
      1-param[2];<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local_param[3] =
      1-param[3];<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invert_spu.super.Materialfv(
      face, mode, local_param );<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invert_spu.super.Materialfv(
      face, mode, param );<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
      }
    </p>
    <p>
      The implementation of <code class="Function">invertClearColor</code> is
      almost identical to the implementation of <code class=
      "Function">invertColor3f</code>, and is not shown here.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Step 6: Test it out!
    </h2>
    <p>
      All that's missing at this point is a configuration script that
      references our new SPU.&nbsp; For this example, we'll just modify the
      <a href="crdemo.conf" class="File">crdemo.conf</a> file that was
      described in the "<a href="configscript.html">Configuration Scripts</a>"
      section of this documentation.&nbsp; Change directories to <span class=
      "Directory">mothership/configs/</span> and copy <span class=
      "File">crdemo.conf</span> to <span class="File">invert.conf</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that's required is a single call to the <code class=
      "Function">AddSPU</code> method of the client node.&nbsp; Around lines 17
      and 18, where the server and client SPUs are created, add the line:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      invert_spu = SPU( 'invert' )
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, immediately before the client SPU is added to the client node (line
      29 in the unmodified <span class="File">crdemo.conf</span>), add the
      line:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      client_node.AddSPU( invert_spu )
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important that the <span class="SPU">invert</span> SPU comes before
      the client SPU in the configuration script, since that is the SPU chain
      order that will be created when the application starts up.&nbsp; Your
      resulting script should <a href="invert.conf">look like this</a>.
    </p>
    <table border="0" width="100%">
      <tr class="Center">
        <td width="50%">
          <img src="bluepony.jpg" class="noborder">

        <td width="50%">

      </tr>
      <tr class="Center">
        <td>
          "bluepony" without the Invert SPU
        </td>
        <td>
          "bluepony" with the Invert SPU
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Step 7: Overriding default OpenGL state
    </h2>
    <p>
      OpenGL is a tricky business, and getting simple things right can
      sometimes be a little hard.&nbsp; For example, what if the user
      <em>never</em> sets the color, material, or clear color, and simply uses
      the defaults?&nbsp; Surely we'd want those colors to be inverted too,
      right? The solution is to override the default OpenGL state.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point we must consider OpenGL rendering contexts. A rendering
      context keeps track of all OpenGL state (such as current color, lighting
      state, blending, textures, etc). Application programs must create at
      least one rendering context (with <code class=
      "Function">glXCreateContext</code>, for example) and bind a context (with
      <code class="Function">glXMakeCurrent</code>) before drawing anything.
      Furthermore, an application may create many rendering contexts and bind
      them at different times to different windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want to override the default state in an OpenGL rendering context,
      the time to do it is immediately after we bind the context for the first
      time. That means we have to override Chromium's <code class=
      "Function">MakeCurrent</code> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an example that overrides the default color, material and clear
      color:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      void INVERTSPU_APIENTRY invertMakeCurrent( GLint crWindow, GLint
      nativeWindow, GLint ctx )<br>
      {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;static GLfloat diffuse[4] = { 1-0.8f, 1-0.8f,
      1-0.8f, 1.0f };<br>

      Note: in this example we're actually overriding the default state
      <em>every</em> time <code class="Function">MakeCurrent</code> is called.
      That's OK if only a little state is being set. Otherwise, we'd have to
      keep track of the context (<code>ctx</code>) parameter and only set the
      state when we saw a new context handle.

    <p>
      The <code>crWindow</code> parameter is Chromium's internal window ID
      number. It's typically a small integer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>nativeWindow</code> parameter is the handle of the
      corresponding native window system window (i.e. an X Window ID).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>ctx</code> parameter is Chromium's internal context ID. It's
      typically a small integer.
    </p>

      We might have alternately called the functions from step 5 with the
      OpenGL defaults, so we wouldn't have inverting logic in too many
      places.&nbsp; Also, careful implementors will want to invert the default
      specular, emission, and ambient colors as well.

      A good program to test this SPU with is the "bluepony" demo that comes
      with GLUT.&nbsp; Notice that the pony is a different color, as is the
      clear color.&nbsp; However, the floor is still the same, because those
      colors were specified with <code class="Function">glColor4fv</code>,
      which we did not implement.&nbsp; For an example of how to write this SPU
      in a more complete and correct way, see "<a href=
      "codegen.html">Automatically generating code for a SPU</a>".
