      CRUT
    </h1>
    <p>
      <u>Disclaimer</u>: CRUT is still in its testing phase. This documentation
      is provided to help people get to know CRUT, but with no warranty that
      everything works exactly as described. For more information of help using
      CRUT, contact <a href="mailto:beermann@cs.virginia.edu">Dale
      Beermann</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>New</u>: CRUT now works with Windows as well. It is not possible to
      render into the <span class="CrApp">crutserver</span>, but CRUT could be
      useful for users running a display wall under windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRUT is the Cluster Rendering Utility Toolkit for Chromium. It allows for
      applications to be written that allow for user interaction through a
      distributed event system. The client-side API for CRUT was designed after
      GLUT so that it is easy to use for people who already know GLUT, and so
      that applications can be ported to Chromium easily. CRUT does not support
      every feature of GLUT, but does provide a major subset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Configuring CRUT requires a few lines to be added to the Chromium
      configuration files. A few different example configurations are provided,
      <span class="File">crut_fan.conf</span>, <span class=
      "File">crut_ring.conf</span>, and <span class=
      "File">crut_proxy.conf</span>. They are examples of different network
      configurations. Because of the latency of a network, it may be beneficial
      to define different configurations of how events propagate through the
      system. The figures below depict two possible configurations, a "fan"
      configuration, where the event server (<span class=
      "CrApp">crutserver</span>) sends each event to every client, and a "ring"
      configuration, where the event server sends the event to one client, and
      the messages are cascaded through the system. The <span class=
      "File">crut_proxy.conf</span> file is an example of a configuration using
      a proxy server. The proxy server can sit between the event server and the
      clients, to receive events from the server and distribute them to the
      clients in some manner. It is unlikely that most users will be using this
      for a while.

      <img src="crut_fan.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="crut_ring.gif">
    </p>
    <p>
      The only lines that were added to the original configuration files look
      like this:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      renderspu.Conf('render_to_crut_window', 1 )<br>
      ...<br>
      crutserver = CRUTServerNode( )<br>
      crutserver.Conf('window_geometry', [100, 100, 400, 400] )<br>
      ...<br>
      appnode1.AddCRUTServer( crutserver , protocol='tcpip', port=9000 )<br>
      ...<br>
      appnode2.AddCRUTServer( appnode1 , protocol='tcpip', port=9001 )
    </p>
    <p>
      The first line tells the <span class="SPU">renderspu</span> that it will
      be rendering into a window managed by the <span class=
      "CrApp">crutserver</span>. The second and third lines define a
      <span class="CrApp">crutserver</span> node, the fourth and fifth define
      the event server for each client. This is an example of the ring
      configuration, where one client is receiving events from another, which
      is in turn receiving events from the <span class=
      "CrApp">crutserver</span>. That's really all that has to be done for the
      configuration file, now you need to know how to incorporate CRUT into
      your own applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE: It is not necessary, nor will it be desirable in many circumstances
      to render into a window put up by the <span class=
      "CrApp">crutserver</span>. Display Walls, for example, can benefit from
      having a dedicated event server sitting in the viewing room. This is
      possible by commenting out the 'render_to_crut_window' option, and making
      the crutserver a dedicated node on a separate computer ( <code>crutserver
      = CRServerNode('event_host')</code> where <code>event_host</code> is the
      computer in the viewing room ).
    </p>
    <p>
      So far there is only one example application provided with the Chromium
      distribution that uses CRUT, called <span class=
      "CrProg">psubmit_crut</span>, it should serve as a good reference. The
      application <span class="CrProg">psubmit_crut</span> is a modification of
      the <span class="CrProg">psubmit</span> application that allows events to
      be handled. The application provides examples of mouse, keyboard, motion,
      and menu event handling. <u>Important</u>: If you are planning on using
      the crutserver to handle CRUT menus, then you will need the <a href=
      "http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/expat" target="_parent">Expat XML
      Parsing Library</a>. The important part of the code is shown below:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      ctx = crutCreateContext(visual);<br>
      <br>
      crutDisplayFunc(DisplayRings);<br>
      crutMouseFunc(mouse);<br>
      crutKeyboardFunc(keyboard);<br>
      crutMotionFunc(motion);<br>
      ...<br>
      crutInitClient();<br>
      ...<br>
      crutMainLoop();
    </p>
    <p>
      The important thing to notice is that all callbacks and menu definitions
      pertaining to CRUT should be done before <code class=
      "Function">crutInitClient</code>. This is because <code class=
      "Function">crutInitClient</code> must tell the mothership what events the
      client is expecting, as well as some other parameters. The function
      <code class="Function">crutMainLoop</code> functions similarly to
      <code class="Function">glutMainLoop</code>, except that every time it
      loops it is checking for any events received over the Chromium network
      layer. One important thing to note is that <code class=
      "Function">crutMainLoop</code> is not necessary. We designed CRUT so that
      the application would not have to give up control to CRUT if it didn't
      want to. This way, an application can be written that checks for events
      whenever it wants, using <code class="Function">crutCheckEvent</code>,
      which is non-blocking, or <code class="Function">crutReceiveEvent</code>,
      which is the blocking version.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently <code class="Function">crutCreateContext</code> must be used to
      create a rendering context. In the future, we intend to implement a local
      version of CRUT that will put up a window so that debugging is made
      easier. That should be just about all you need to know to start
      implementing your own programs using CRUT. However, there are currently a
      few dependencies you need to be aware of when running your application
      with Chromium. At least one <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span> must be
      started before the <span class="CrApp">crutserver</span> can be started,
      and the <span class="CrApp">crutserver</span> must be started before the
      <span class="CrApp">crserver</span>. This is because the <span class=
      "CrApp">crutserver</span> needs to know what events it will be sending
      across the network, which it finds out from the client, and the
      <span class="CrApp">crserver</span> needs to know what window it will be
      rendering into, which it finds out from the <span class=
      "CrApp">crutserver</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note</b>: If you're a Chromium developer and have made symlinks
      pointing from <span class="File">libGL.so</span> and <span class=
      "File">libGL.so.1</span> to <span class="File">libcrfaker</span> you'll
      have to remove those symlinks in order for CRUT to work.
    </p>

    <h3>
      CRUT Server Configuration Options
    </h3>

    <p>
    The following configuration options are accepted by the CRUT server.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>window_geometry</b> - a 4-element list [x, y, width, height] which
        indicates the initial window position and size.
    </li>
    <li><b>exit_on_escape</b> - if the value is non-zero, the CRUT Server will
        exit when the escape key is pressed.
    </li>
    <li><b>composite_mode</b> - if the CRUT server is being used for image
        compositing, this option can be set to 'alpha' or 'depth' to indicate
        which kind of compositing is being done.
        This helps to choose the right kind of visual for the CRUT window.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Example code:
    </p>
    <pre>
       crutserver = CRUTServerNode()
       crutserver.Conf('window_geometry', [0, 0, 640, 480])
       crutserver.Conf('exit_on_escape', 1)
       crutserver.Conf('composite_mode', 'depth')
    </pre>
