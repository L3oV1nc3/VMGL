<h1 class="PageHeading">Writing a Threaded Application</h1>

<p>If you have a multiprocessor system, a multi-threaded application may
be a good way to leverage your computing power.</p>

<p>The previous section described how one can implement parallel rendering
for a cluster of PCs.
It's often the case that applications are more easily parallelized on a
shared memory symetric multiprocessor (SMP) system than a distributed
memory system (a PC cluster).
Also, some types of visualization tasks may make better use of memory if
the dataset is shared by N threads within one process, rather than replicated
across N systems in a cluster.</p>

<p>As a concrete example, suppose we have a 4-pipe SGI Onyx system.
If we create four rendering threads we can render part of the scene with
each of the four pipes and display a sort-last-composited image on the
user's screen.</p>

<h2 class="PageSubHeading">The Threadtest demo</h2>

<p>In <code>progs/threadtest/threadtest.c</code> you'll find an example
of a threaded Chromium application.
It's actually very similar to the psubmit demo.</p>

<p>The threadtest program accepts the following command line arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-t numThreads</code> indicates how many threads to create.
The default is one.
<li><code>-w</code> specifies that a separate window should be created for
each thread.  The default is for all threads to render into one window.
<li><code>-s1</code> specifies that only one thread should issue SwapBuffers
commands.  The default is for all threads to swap their windows.
<li><code>-b</code> specifies that barriers should be used for synchronization.
</ul>

<p>The <code>threadtest.c</code> program is very similar to the
<code>psubmit.c</code> program.
The major difference is the addition of code to create the N rendering
threads (using Windows threads or pthreads).
Like <code>psubmit.c</code>, barriers are used after glClear and before
SwapBuffers in order to provide synchronization.</p>

<p><code>mothership/configs/threadtest.conf</code> is a sample configuration
file for running the threadtest demo.
This configuration file will pass the appropriate command line arguments to
the threadtest program.
It has several options to demonstrate various multi-threaded configurations.
Look near the top of the file for these options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>NumThreads</code> indicates the number of threads to create
<li><code>Config</code> can take one of four values: LOCAL_ONE_WINDOW,
LOCAL_N_WINDOWS, REMOTE_ONE_WINDOW or SORT_LAST.  These demonstrate
different types of parallelism.
</ul>

<p>The LOCAL_ONE_WINDOW option will create one window which all N threads
will render into in parallel.
glClear and SwapBuffers are synchronized with barriers.
There is no server node; just run the mothership and crappfaker.</p>

<p>The LOCAL_N_WINDOWS option will create one window which all N threads
will render into in parallel.
There is no server node; just run the mothership and crappfaker.</p>

<p>The REMOTE_ONE_WINDOW option uses a pack SPU to send N streams of
rendering commands to a render SPU running on a server node.
Run the mothership, a crserver and crappfaker.</p>

<p>The SORT_LAST option uses a readback SPU to render N partial images
which are sent to render SPU on a downstream server.
Run the mothership, a crserver and crappfaker.
Note that we don't use the -b option since the readback SPU itself will
implement barrier synchronization.
</p>

<p>Threaded sort-first rendering with the tilesort SPU is also possible
but is not implemented in the configuration script.</p>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Enabling Thread Safety in Chromium</h2>

<p>Chromium is not thread-safe by default.  To enable thread safety,
edit the <code>options.mk</code> file, run <code>make clean</code>
then run <code>make</code>.
