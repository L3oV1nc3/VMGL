<h1 class="PageHeading">Test Programs</h1>
<p>This section describes test programs included with Chromium.
</p>

<h2 class="PageSubHeading">tiletest</h2>
<p>
The tiletest program verifies that the tilesort SPU is working correctly.
It can also be used to visually experiment with simple tile layouts and
load balancing.
</p>

<p>
The tiletest program verifies that tilesorting is working correctly
by doing the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the Chromium tilesort SPU for the number of servers, the number
of tiles per server, and the size and location of all tiles.
<li>Draw a colored square corresponding to each tile.  The tile color
indicates the server.  Each tile is also labeled 'sXtY' to indicate server
number X and tile number Y.
<li>Draw a cube centered in each tile.
<li>As the cubes are drawn, the tilesort SPU records the number of vertices
sent to each render server.
<li>Query the servers to determine how many vertices each received.
<li>Print a report of the results and compare the number of vertices
received to the number expected.
</ul>

<p>
Three tests are performed by changing the granularity of the
glBegin/glEnd primitives:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Per-face: glBegin and glEnd are called for each face of each cube.
<li>Per-cube: glBegin and glEnd are called once for each cube.
<li>Per-scene: glBegin and glEnd are called just once for the whole test.
</ul>

<p>
In the first two cases each tile should receive 24 vertices (the number
of vertices per cube).  So if a server has T tiles, the server should
receive 24T vertices.
</p>
<p>
In the last case all cube vertices should be sent to all servers since
Chromium bins only whole glBegin/glEnd primitives.
Therefore, if C cubes are drawn, each server should receive 24C vertices.
</p>

<p>
The tiletest program can also be used to experiment with tile layouts.
Run tiletest with the -t option.  You'll see a matrix of colored squares.
Each color represents a different server.  The number of servers, tile
rows and tile columns can be changed with the keyboard:
</p>

<ul>
<li>s/S = decrease/increase number of servers
<li>r/R = decrease/increase rows of tiles
<li>c/C = decrease/increase columns of tiles
</ul>

<p>
The following shows a configuration with 3 servers and a 4x4 array of tiles.
It's a good configuration because the tiles are evenly distributed.

<p>
If we increase the number of servers to 4 and use a naive tile allocation
then we'll get the following configuration:

<p>
The point is that the tile configuration for a given number of servers
is important and determines how well the rendering load is balanced among
the servers.
