      Parallel rendering is characterized by more two or more programs (or
      threads) simultaneously sending graphics commands to the rendering
      system. Typically, each process (or thread) will render a part of the
      entire model or scene. The pieces are combined at some point to form the
      final image.
    </p>
    <p>
      When rendering very large, complex models, the bottleneck may be in
      submitting graphics commands to the rendering system. Parallel rendering
      tries to overcome that bottleneck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we describe parallel rendering with Chromium by using a trivial
      program called <span class="CrProg">psubmit</span>.

      The Basic Idea
    </h2>
    <p>
      Writing a parallel OpenGL application is pretty simple.&nbsp; You have a
      bunch of processes, each one of which is responsible for a portion of the
      model to be rendered.&nbsp; Each process renders its portion pretty much
      as if it were the only process in the world.&nbsp; The partial renderings
      may either be composited together according to Z or alpha (sort-last) or
      tiled together (sort-first). However, <em>ordering</em> requirements add
      some complexity to the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenGL provides <em>ordered semantics</em>.&nbsp; That means that if
      function A is called before function B, the resulting image should look
      as if A happened before B.&nbsp; With parallel programs it's no longer
      clear which function is getting called first.&nbsp; Therefore, if you
      aren't using the depth test (for example), and you draw two overlapping
      triangles in parallel, you don't know which one will appear on top.&nbsp;
      To get around this problem, Chromium implements the parallel API proposed
      by <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/parallel_api/" target=
      "_parent">Igehy, Stoll and Hanrahan in SIGGRAPH '98</a>.&nbsp; This API
      extends OpenGL to have barriers and semaphores, which are sufficient to
      express almost all ordering constraints that come up in graphics.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      The psubmit Program
    </h2>
    <p>
      Let's take a look at the <code class="Function">main</code> function of
      <span class="File">psubmit.c</span> in <span class=
      "Directory">progs/psubmit/</span>.&nbsp; The first thing this function
      does is determines how many of its peers exist, and which instance number
      (starting from 0) this particular <code class="Function">main</code> is
      running in.&nbsp; In <span class="CrProg">psubmit</span>, this is done
      with command line arguments, although more complex programs will probably
      need to do some sort of application-level communication or
      synchronization and would get this information from, say, MPI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the rank and size of the program are determined, the following two
      lines appear:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      context = crCreateContextCR( dpy, visual );<br>
      crMakeCurrentCR( window, context );
    </p>
    <p>
      <code class="Function">crCreateContextCR</code> and <code class=
      "Function">crMakeCurrentCR</code> are actually function pointers
      initialized via <code class="Function">crGetProcAddress</code>. The
      typedefs for these functions are in the header file "<span class=
      "File">chromium.h</span>". They provide a mechanism to use Chromium
      without using GLX or WGL and having to create application windows, etc.
      This is particularly useful for parallel applications, since it doesn't
      really make sense to have a bunch of blank faked-out windows popping up
      all over the cluster.&nbsp; This also means that the client nodes in the
      cluster do not have to have a graphical environment running just to house
      a blank faked-out window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>dpy</code>, <code>visual</code> and <code>window</code>
      parameters are initialied earlier in the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing that the application does is create a GL barrier:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      glBarrierCreateCR( MASTER_BARRIER, size );
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that every node in the cluster will create this barrier.&nbsp;
      This is perfectly legal, as long as the "size" parameter matches
      up.&nbsp; <code>MASTER_BARRIER</code> is just an integer that "names"
      this barrier, much like an OpenGL display list or texture object (except
      that the namespace is shared between clients by default).
    </p>
    <p>
      After some GL initialization code comes the main drawing loop.&nbsp; This
      application follows the basic format of all simple parallel OpenGL
      applications. The basic structure of the code is:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      for( frame = 0; ; frame++ )<br>
      {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if( clearFlag )<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glClear(
      GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT );<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glBarrierExecCR( MASTER_BARRIER );<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw the scene here<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glBarrierExecCR( MASTER_BARRIER );<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (swapFlag)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crSwapBuffersCR( window,
      0 );<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crSwapBuffersCR( window,
      CR_SUPPRESS_SWAP_BIT );<br>
      }
    </p>
    <p>
      A few things to note about this code:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <code>clearFlag</code> is set by the <code>-clear</code> command
      line option.
      </li>
      <li>The <code>swapFlag</code> is set by the <code>-swap</code> command
      line option.
      </li>
      <li>The <code>CR_SUPPRESS_SWAP_BIT</code> flag is used in sort-last
      configurations to mark the end of the frame without actually swapping the
      buffer.
      </li>
      <li>In a sort-last configuration <code>clearFlag</code> is set by all
      clients and <code>swapFlag</code> will be set only for the zeroth client.
      </li>
      <li>In a sort-first configuration <code>clearFlag</code> and
      <code>swapFlag</code> will be set only for the zeroth client.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code class="Function">glBarrierExecCR</code> (also declared in
        <span class="File">chromium.h</span>) is the call to enter a barrier.
      </li>
      <li>The barrier following the clear ensures that the clear has happened
      before <em>anyone</em> starts drawing
      </li>
      <li>The barrier preceding the swap ensures that <em>everyone</em> is
      finished drawing before the buffers are swapped
      </li>
      <li>Barriers (and semaphores) do <em>not</em> block the
      application.&nbsp; They simply indicate ordering constraints to be obeyed
      by the server when switching contexts.&nbsp; Therefore, the clients do
      not have to stall, and can get ahead of the servers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are two sample parallel submission configuration scripts included
      with Chromium. <span class="File">psubmit_first.conf</span> demonstrates
      parallel sort-first rendering with the <span class="SPU">tilesort
      SPU</span>. <span class="File">psubmit_last.conf</span> demonstrates
      parallel sort-last rendering with the <span class="SPU">readback</span>
      SPU.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run the psubmit_first demo you'll need to issue the following
      commands, probably from five separate shell windows:
    </p>
    <ul class="Command">
      <li>cd mothership/configs ; python psubmit_first.conf
      </li>
      <li>crserver
      </li>
      <li>crserver
      </li>
      <li>crappfaker
      </li>
      <li>crappfaker
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To run the psubmit_last demo you'll need to issue the following commands,
      probably from four separate shell windows:
    </p>
    <ul class="Command">
      <li>cd mothership/configs ; python psubmit_last.conf
      </li>
      <li>crserver
      </li>
      <li>crappfaker
      </li>
      <li>crappfaker
      </li>
    </ul>

      Parallel Programming Difficulties
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among the difficulties in writing parallel applications are dealing with
      user input events and window management. Suppose you want to implement
      interactive rotation in your parallel application. Since there are N
      client/application windows, mouse movement events that are detected in
      one window should be duplicated in all the other windows. Otherwise only
      part of the rendering will be rotated. Similarly, if one window is
      resized, they should all be resized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chromium comes with a toolkit similar to GLUT, tentatively called CRUT
      (Chromium Utility Toolkit). With CRUT, input events and window changes
      are automatically sent to all peers in a parallel application. For more
      information, see the <a href="crut.html">CRUT</a> page.
