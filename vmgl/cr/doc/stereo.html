<h1 class="PageHeading">Stereo Rendering</h1>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Introduction</h2>

<p>
Chromium supports four types of stereo rendering:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Active</b> (LCD shutter glasses) - Alternate left and right
images are displayed on the screen and the user wears LCD shutter
glasses which alternately show and hide the left right views.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Passive</b> (polarized light) - Separate left and right images
are displayed by separate projectors pointing at a single screen.  The
user wears glasses with polarized lenses which match the polarization
of the projected images.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Side-by-side</b> - the left and right eye views are displayed
side-by-side in one window.  The user may either defocus or cross
his eyes to see the stereo effect.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Anaglyph</b> - anaglyph stereo renders left and right images with
different colors which match glasses with color filters over the lenses.
Red/blue is a common color combination.
</ul>

<p>
Stereo rendering is supported for two classes of OpenGL applications:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Stereo-aware applications</b> - the OpenGL application requests
a stereo visual and renders separate left and right images to the
left/right color buffers specified by calls to glDrawBuffer().  This
method is typically used with active stereo hardware but Chromium
allows this method to be used with passive stereo hardware as well.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Non-stereo applications</b> - Chromium can trick an OpenGL
application into rendering stereo images.  Both active and passive
stereo modes are possible.  The user must specify special stereo
configuration information.
</ul>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Running Stereo-Aware Applications</h2>

<h3>Active Stereo</h3>

<p>
Stereo applications using active stereo should work without modification
with Chromium.
That is, if the application requests a stereo-capable visual and the
graphics hardware can support it, stereo rendering should work as expected.
</p>
<p>
One potential problem however, is with tiled displays.
The SwapBuffers operation and vertical refresh of all the display screens
should be synchronized.
This is an area still open to research.
</p>

<h3>Passive Stereo</h3>

<p>
A stereo OpenGL application can be made to run on a passive stereo display
system by setting special configuration options.
</p>

<p>
In its simplest configuration, a tilesort SPU drives two crservers, one
designated for the left eye and the other for the right eye.
Calls to glDrawBuffer() control which crserver is rendered to.
In a more sophisticated configuration, a tilesort SPU may have a larger
number of crservers (half designated for the left eye and the other
half for the right eye), each half forming a tiled mural.
</p>

<p>
The <code>stereo1.conf</code> configuration file demonstrates how to run
a stereo-aware OpenGL application on passive stereo hardware.
The important points follow (though this doesn't match stereo1.conf):
</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a tilesort SPU and set its configuration parameters:
<pre>
    tilesortspu = SPU('tilesort')
    tilesortspu.Conf('bucket_mode', 'Frustum')
    tilesortspu.Conf('stereo_mode', 'Passive')
</pre>
Note that using 'Frustum' bucket mode isn't required but may work more
reliably than other bucketing methods.<br><br>

<li>Create two crserver/network nodes with identical tile information:
<pre>
    leftServer = CRNetworkNode()
    rightServer = CRNetworkNode()
    leftServer.AddTile(0, 0, TileWidth, TileHeight)
    rightServer.AddTile(0, 0, TileWidth, TileHeight)
</pre>

<li>Specify each whether the servers render the left or right-eye view
and add the servers to the tilesort SPU:
<pre>
    leftServer.Conf('stereo_view', 'left')
    rightServer.Conf('stereo_view', 'right')
    tilesortspu.AddServer(leftServer, port=7000)
    tilesortspu.AddServer(rightServer, port=7001)
</pre>

</ul>


<h3>Side-by-side or Anaglyph</h3>

<p>
Side-by-side stereo shows the left and right eye views in one window.
Viewers may either defocus their eyes or cross their eyes to view the
stereo pair.
Anaglyph stereo draws two images with different colors and requires the
user to wear glasses with colored lenses (such as red and blue) to view
the stereo image.
</p>
<p>
Both methods are supported in Chromium's tilesort SPU because they are
relatively easy to implement, though not especially valuable in practice.
</p>
<p>
The key steps in setting up side-by-side mode are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the stereo mode:
<pre>
    tilesortspu.Conf('stereo_mode', 'SideBySide')
</pre>
<li>Configure the crserver(s) for a window/mural that's typically twice
as wide as the application's window:
<pre>
    server = CRNetworkNode()
    server.AddTile(0, 0, 2 * AppWinWidth, AppWinHeight)
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
The key steps for setting up anaglyph mode are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the stereo mode:
<pre>
    tilesortspu.Conf('stereo_mode', 'Anaglyph')
    tilesortspu.Conf('glasses_type', 'RedBlue')
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>stereo2.conf</code> configuration file supports both of
these modes.
</p>




<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Running Non-Stereo Programs in Stereo Mode</h2>

<p>
With Chromium one can coerce a non-stereo OpenGL application into rendering
stereo imagery.
</p>

<p>
Similar to <a href="nonplanar.html">non-planar tilesorting</a>, the
Python configuration file can specify special view and projection
matrices to override those specified in the application.
Separate viewing and projection matrices are specified for each eye/view.
</p>

<p>
The <code>crmatrix.py</code> module has a number of matrix functions
which are useful for specifying the view and projection transformations.
</p>

<p>
The geometric transformations for rendering left and right stereo views
may be computed in several ways.
For example, left and right views may be <em>rotation</em> or
<em>translation</em>-based.
Chromium imposes no specific transformations; they're completely specified
by the user's configuration file.
In the examples here, we use a simple interocular translation to produce
the left and right view transformations and skewed perspective frustums
for the projection transformations.
</p>


<h3>Passive Stereo</h3>

<p>
As described earlier, a passive stereo configuration will use a tilesort
SPU and a set of crserver nodes which are designated as left or right views.
</p>
<p>
The specific configuration steps include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Create and configure a tilesort SPU:
<pre>
    tilesortspu = SPU("tilesort")
    tilesortspu.Conf('bucket_mode', 'Frustum')
    tilesortspu.Conf('stereo_mode', 'Passive')
</pre>

<li>Create and configure left and right crserver nodes:
<pre>
    leftServer = CRNetworkNode( )
    leftServer.AddTile( 0, 0, TileWidth, TileHeight )
    rightServer = CRNetworkNode( )
    rightServer.AddTile( 0, 0, TileWidth, TileHeight )

    # Left node view matrix
    v = crmatrix.CRMatrix()
    v.Translate(+EyeSep, 0, 0)
    leftServerConf('view_matrix', v.ToList())

    # Right node view matrix
    v = crmatrix.CRMatrix()
    v.Translate(-EyeSep, 0, 0)
    rightServerConf('view_matrix', v.ToList())

    # Left node projection matrix
    p = crmatrix.CRMatrix()
    left = s * ((Width * -Aspect) - EyeSep);
    right = s * ((Width * Aspect) - EyeSep);
    p.Frustum(left, right, bottom, top, Hither, Yon)
    leftServerConf('projection_matrix', p.ToList())

    # Right node projection matrix
    p = crmatrix.CRMatrix()
    left = s * (Width * -Aspect + EyeSep);
    right = s * (Width * Aspect + EyeSep);
    p.Frustum(left, right, bottom, top, Hither, Yon)
    rightServerConf('projection_matrix', p.ToList())
</pre>

<p>
Note that the <em>EyeSep</em>, <em>Width</em>, <em>Aspect</em>,
<em>Hither</em>, and <em>Yon</em> variables are set earlier in the
configuration file and will have to be adjusted to suit the
application.
</p>


<li>Specify each whether the servers render the left or right-eye view
and add the servers to the tilesort SPU:
<pre>
    leftServer.Conf('stereo_view', 'left')
    rightServer.Conf('stereo_view', 'right')
    tilesortspu.AddServer(leftServer, port=7000)
    tilesortspu.AddServer(rightServer, port=7001)
</pre>

</ul>

<p>
The <code>stereo1.conf</code> configuration, run with the <code>-force</code>
option can be used to demonstrate forcing a non-stereo application to
render in passive stereo mode.
Examine the file to learn how the view/projection parameters have been
fine-tuned for several programs.
For other programs one will have to examine the viewing/projection
parameters normally used, and adapt them for stereo.
If the application's soure code is not available, this will have to be
done by trial and error.
</p>



<h3>Active Stereo</h3>

<p>
To make a non-stereo application produce images for active stereo it
has to be tricked into rendering the everything twice, once for the
left color buffer (GL_LEFT) and once for the right (GL_RIGHT).  Also,
the render SPU's window must use a stereo-capable visual.
</p>

<p>
The functionality for making a non-stereo application run in active
stereo mode is encoded in the tilesort SPU (though this functionality
may be moved into a separate stereo SPU in the future).
</p>

<p>
The procedure for setting up active stereo is similar to passive
stereo but the left/right view/projection matrices are specified to the
tilesort SPU instead of the crservers.
This is because there may, in fact, be only one crserver which is
alternately display the left and right color buffers.
</p>

<p>
Here are the primary steps for active stereo.  For a complete
demonstration, see the <code>stereo2.conf</code> configuration file.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Create and configure a tilesort SPU:
<pre>
    tilesortspu = SPU("tilesort")
    tilesortspu.Conf('bucket_mode', 'Test All Tiles')
    tilesortspu.Conf('force_quad_buffering', 1)
    tilesortspu.Conf('stereo_mode', 'CrystalEyes')
</pre>

<p>
The <em>force_quad_buffering</em> option is explained below.
</p>

<li>Create the crserver node with render SPU:
<pre>
    renderspu = SPU('render')
    renderspu.Conf('window_geometry', [0, 0, TileWidth, TileHeight])
    renderspu.Conf('default_visual', 'rgb, z, double, stereo')

    server = CRNetworkNode()
    server.AddTile(0, 0, TileWidth, TileHeight)
    server.Conf('optimize_bucket', 0)  # just to be safe
    server.AddSPU(renderspu)
    cr.AddNode(server)

    tilesortspu.AddServer(server, protocol='tcpip', port=7000)
</pre>

<li>Specify the left/right view/projection matrices for the server node:
<pre>
    # Left view matrix
    v = crmatrix.CRMatrix()
    v.Translate(+EyeSep, 0, 0)
    servernode.Conf('view_matrix', v.ToList())

    # Right view matrix
    v = crmatrix.CRMatrix()
    v.Translate(-EyeSep, 0, 0)
    servernode.Conf('right_view_matrix', v.ToList())

    # Left projection matrix
    p = crmatrix.CRMatrix()
    left = s * ((Width * -Aspect) - EyeSep);
    right = s * ((Width * Aspect) - EyeSep);
    p.Frustum(left, right, bottom, top, Hither, Yon)
    servernode.Conf('projection_matrix', p.ToList())

    # Right projection matrix
    p = crmatrix.CRMatrix()
    left = s * ((Width * -Aspect) + EyeSep);
    right = s * ((Width * Aspect) + EyeSep);
    p.Frustum(left, right, bottom, top, Hither, Yon)
    servernode.Conf('right_projection_matrix', p.ToList())
</pre>

</ul>

<p>
The <em>force_quad_buffering</em> option tricks the application into
rendering every frame twice.  The magic takes place in the
SwapBuffers() function.  After rendering the first (left) view the
tilesort SPU calls glDrawBuffer(GL_RIGHT) and sends an X Expose event
to the application.  The event causes the application to redraw the
window.  When the the second drawing is done and SwapBuffers() is
called again, glDrawBuffer(GL_LEFT) is called to get ready for drawing
the next left view.
</p>
<p>
The call to glDrawBuffer(GL_LEFT or GL_RIGHT) also causes the tilesort
SPU to install either the left or right view/projection matrices needed
for that view.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, there don't appear to be any easy solutions to those problems.
</p>


<h3>Side-by-side or Anaglyph</h3>

<p>
Side-by-side and anaglyph stereo modes (desribed above) may also be used
to run apps that aren't normally stereo aware.
Again, the <code>stereo2.conf</code> file supports both modes.
</p>



<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Known Problems</h2>

<p>
OpenGL applications written to use quad-buffered stereo should
(in general) work fine with Chromium.
However, forcing non-stereo applications into stereo rendering mode
will not always work.
This section explains the known issues.
</p>

<H3>Simulating Quad-buffering</H3>

<p>
When the tilesort SPU's <code>force_quad_buffering</code> option is set,
an X Expose event is sent to the application to trick it into redrawing
the scene from the other eye's point of view.
</p>

<p>
This solution is only implemented on X-based systems at this time.
A similar mechanism is needed for Windows and Darwin.
</p>

<p>
Using an Expose event to trigger the redraw isn't infallible - it
may simply not work with some applications because of how their event
loops are written.
Also, if the application updates any animation parameters between
drawing the left and right views the stereo pair not be matched in
time, causing some problems.
</p>


<H3>Changing Projections</H3>

<p>
Only one projection and view matrix transformation can be specified in
the Chromium configuration file.
If the application uses a variety of projections, it may be hard or even
impossible to find a suitable projection matrix in the configuration file
that always works.
</p>

<p>
Another problem occurs when the application switches between a perspective
projection (to render 3D elements) and an orthographic projection (to
render 2D elements).
The 2D elements probably won't appear correctly since the orthographic
projection will be overriden in the configuration file.
</p>


<h3>Finding Suitable Stereo Parameters</H3>

<p>
As seen in the stereo1.conf and stereo2.conf sample configurations,
the stereo projection parameters usually need to be customized for
each application.
Determining suitable projection parameters can be difficult, especially
when source code for the application is not available.
</p>

<p>
If the application source is available, look for glFrustum() and
gluPerspective() commands.
These commands will show the parameters used for the near and far
clipping planes and the width/height of the viewing frustum.
</p>

<p>
These values can be plugged into the sample configuration files.
The focal distance is a value between the near and far values, typically
closer to the near plane.
The interocular eye separation is typically a small value, but will have
to be tuned by trial and error.
</p>

<p>
If the application source is not available you'll have to do some
detective work to discover suitable projection parameters.
One technique is to examine the OpenGL commands emitted by the application
using the print SPU.
Use the print SPU to log the OpenGL commands to a file.
Then inspect the file for glFrustum() commands or changes to the
GL_PROJECTION matrix.
If you find the GL_PROJECTION matrix values, you can compute the original
glFrustum parameters by using the DecomposeProjection() function found
in the crmatrix.py Python module.
Once you have the frustum parameters, you can try similar values for
the stereo projection.
