      Debugging a SPU
    </h1>
    <p>
      Debugging a Chromium SPU can be difficult (especially on the application
      side). The normal approach of running an application with a debugger
      won't work since the crappfaker is needed in order to make the
      application use Chromium instead of the native OpenGL library. Debugging
      the <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span> doesn't typically work since
      <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span> forks/execs the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section describes some techniques you can use to debug a SPU.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Windows Technique 1: Write a batch file
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is by far the simplest thing you can do with Windows. Create a batch
      file called <span class="File">crdebug.bat</span>, which contains the
      following commands:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      cp %1.exe c:/work/cr/scratch<br>
      cp c:/work/cr/bin/WIN_NT/crfaker.dll c:/work/cr/scratch/opengl32.dll<br>
      "C:\VS60\Common\MSDev98\Bin\MSDEV.EXE" c:\work\cr\scratch\%1.exe
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this batch file (typically put in <span class=
      "Directory">bin/WIN_NT/</span>), go to the directory containing the
      executable, and type:
    </p>
    <p class="DebugStep">
      crdebug &lt;executable_name&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
      That's it.&nbsp; But one will have to modify the paths to match where
      Chromium is installed on the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      This uses a "scratch" directory made in <span class=
      "Directory">c:\work\cr\scratch</span>.&nbsp; It basically copies the
      faker DLL to the scratch directory, along with the executable, and runs
      the debugger on the executable.&nbsp; Windows will search the directory
      that contains the executable first, so this technique works (it's a lot
      like how the application faker works).
    </p>
    <p>
      This technique has a drawback, however.&nbsp; Since SPUs are loaded
      explicitly when an OpenGL context is created, you cannot set a breakpoint
      inside a SPU when the program is loaded.&nbsp; You have to single-step
      through the program until the context is created, and then you may set
      breakpoints.&nbsp; Every time you restart the Microsoft debugger, your
      breakpoints will all be temporarily disabled.&nbsp; You can re-enable
      them all at once by using the "<span class=
      "MenuItem">Edit-&gt;Breakpoints</span>" menu item.&nbsp; This is tedious,
      but it's the path of least resistance.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Windows Technique 2: Use a programmatic breakpoint
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Windows, you can add the statement:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      DebugBreak();
    </p>
    <p>
      anywhere in your code, and when that statement is executed, you will be
      prompted to load the debugger at that point.&nbsp; The debugger will come
      up pointing at some assembly code, and by stepping forward (with the F10
      key) twice, you'll be back at the place where <code class=
      "Function">DebugBreak</code> appears.&nbsp; The program is still running!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is often a useful technique for setting conditional breakpoints deep
      within a library, since you don't have to worry about waiting for the
      context to be created, etc.&nbsp; Also, this is by far the best way to
      enter the debugger in your <code class="Function">SPUInit</code>
      function.
    </p>

      Linux: Create a "debug" directory
    </h2>
    <p>
      To debug SPU's on Linux, create a directory called <span class=
      "Directory">ldebug/</span>, which is populated with symlinks to the
      OpenGL faker library.&nbsp; Here is a listing of the contents of that
      directory:
    </p>
    <p class="Output">
      chromite(cr)% ls -l ldebug<br>
      total 0<br>
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 humper graphics 41 Jul 3 10:24 libGL.so -&gt;
      /u/humper/work/cr/lib/Linux/libcrfaker.so*<br>
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 humper graphics 8 Jul 3 10:25 libGL.so.1 -&gt; libGL.so*<br>
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 humper graphics 8 Jul 3 10:25 libGL.so.1.0.1251 -&gt;
      libGL.so*
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have "<span class="Directory">.</span>" (the current directory) on
      your <span class="EnvVar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>, you can just change to
      this directory before invoking the debugger.&nbsp; Otherwise, add this
      directory to the head of your <span class=
      "EnvVar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>. Then, run <span class="App">gdb</span>
      on the application:
    </p>
    <p class="DebugStep">
      % gdb atlantis
    </p>
    <p>
      Set a breakpoint in main and run the program:
    </p>
    <p class="DebugStep">
      (gdb) break main<br>
      (gdb) run
    </p>
    <p>
      When execution stops in main, set a breakpoint in glXMakeCurrent() then
      continue:
    </p>
    <p class="DebugStep">
      (gdb) break glXMakeCurrent<br>
      (gdb) c
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the SPUs will have been loaded and you can set breakpoints
      in SPU functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      One disadvantage to this technique is that you won't have control over
      the application's working directory.&nbsp; If you need data files
      (textures, usually), you can make symlinks to those too.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Windows/Unix: Attach a debugger to a running process
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many systems will allow you to attach a debugger to a running process
      without interrupting it.&nbsp; In Windows, you can do this simply by
      right clicking on the process name in the Task Manager. With Linux start
      gdb with "<span class="Command">gdb</span> <em>program</em>
      <em>processID</em>". &nbsp; This way, if you want to emulate the
      <code class="Function">DebugBreak</code> functionality without using it
      explicitly, you can do something like:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      volatile int i = 10; // so the compiler doesn't warn or optimize it
      away<br>
      while (i == 10)<br>
      {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// EMPTY BODY<br>
      }
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your program starts to loop forever, attach the debugger, force the
      value of <code>i</code> to be something else, and you've got your
      homemade breakpoint.&nbsp; This is pretty tedious, but handy sometimes
      when <code class="Function">DebugBreak</code> isn't available.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Unix, use ps to find the process ID of the application. Then, start
      the debugger, specifying the program and process ID. On Linux this can
      done with:
    </p>
    <p class="DebugStep">
      gdb atlantis 12345
    </p>
    <p>
      Where 12345 is the process ID.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Any OS: Debug SPUs on the crserver
    </h2>
    <p>
      Debugging the crserver and SPUs hosted on the crserver is usually easier
      than debugging SPUs on the application side because no library tricks are
      used, nor is fork/exec used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply run the crserver with your debugger. Set a breakpoint in the
      <code class="Function">crSPULoadChain</code>. After that function has
      finished, you should be able to put breakpoints in any SPU function.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Any OS: Use the Print SPU liberally
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <span class="SPU">print</span> SPU has made debugging of other SPU's
      much easier.&nbsp; By placing it between the client and its SPU, and also
      in front of the <span class="SPU">render</span> SPU on a server, you can
      see exactly what transformations are being made to the stream by
      comparing the two printouts.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Any OS: printf
    </h2>
    <p>
      If all else fails, the tried and true method of inserting <span class=
      "Function">printf()</span>'s in your code is one way to determine what's
      going on.
