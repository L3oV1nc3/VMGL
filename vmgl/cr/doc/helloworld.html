      Your First Chromium Run
    </h1>
    <p>
      Your first Chromium run will be something quite simple. One of the
      programs built during the compile of the Chromium system is called
      "<span class="CrProg">fonttest</span>" - you can go ahead and run it now.
      If everything is OK, you should see a window appear with a text message
      in it. This window is using the system's OpenGL - nothing
      Chromium-related has happened yet. To run this program using Chromium,
      you will need to follow these four steps (you'll need three shell windows
      open):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Set up your search path.
        <p>
          The Chromium executable programs are located in <span class=
          "Directory">cr/bin/<em>ARCH</em></span>. On Linux, for example, it'll
          be <span class="Directory">cr/bin/Linux</span>. If you're using Unix
          you should edit your <span class="File">.cshrc</span> or <span class=
          "File">.bash</span> or similar shell start-up file and add
          <span class="Directory">cr/bin/<em>ARCH</em></span> to the search
          path.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't do this you'll have to provide the full path to the
          crserver and crappfaker programs below.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Start the mothership.
        <p>
          Components of any Chromium run will need to know what they are
          supposed to be doing. They get this information from the
          <em>configuration mothership</em>. The mothership is controlled by
          scripts written in the <a href="http://www.python.org" target=
          "_parent">Python</a> programming language. One such script is located
          in <span class="File">cr/mothership/configs/crdemo.conf</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Change to the <span class="Directory">cr/mothership/configs</span>
          directory, and type:
        </p>
        <p class="Command">
          python crdemo.conf fonttest
        </p>
        <p>
          The mothership will now be running, and you should see a message to
          that effect.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Start a Chromium server.
        <p>
          In another window run:
        </p>
        <p class="Command">
          crserver
        </p>
        <p>
          That's all there is to it. The Chromium server will configure itself
          by asking questions to the mothership that you ran in step 1. The
          server will dispatch the incoming stream of commands to the first SPU
          hosted by the server (the <span class="SPU">Render</span> SPU in this
          case). Note: previous versions of Chromium would open a window at
          this point.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Start the application.
        <p>
          In a third window, start the Chromium "application faker". This is a
          loader program that will start another unmodified application and
          make sure that it finds the Chromium OpenGL shared library instead of
          the system's. Run:
        </p>
        <p class="Command">
          crappfaker
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the faker (and the OpenGL DLL, and the SPU's loaded by the
          OpenGL DLL) will all configure themselves by asking questions of the
          mothership started in step 1.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Once the application starts, you should see two windows appear: the
      Render SPU window and the application window. The application window
      belongs to the <span class="CrProg">fonttest</span> program started by
      the application faker. As far as <span class="CrProg">fonttest</span>
      knows, it is rendering to that window. The Chromium OpenGL DLL intercepts
      all of <span class="CrProg">fonttest</span>'s calls to OpenGL and sends
      them over the network (in this case, a TCP/IP connection to your local
      machine) to the Chromium server, where they are dispatched to the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chromium run you have just done corresponds to the following graph of
      nodes:

      Other Sample Configurations
    </h1>
    <p>
      The Chromium distribution includes many sample configurations to
      demonstrate the capabilities of Chromium. Here's a summary of the scripts
      found in <span class="Directory">mothership/configs</span>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span class="File">autodmx.conf</span> - a demonstration of Chromium
          and DMX in autostart mode.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span class="File">blur.conf</span> - another example of OpenGL
          command filtering. This one demontrates the <span class=
          "SPU">motionblur SPU</span>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span class="File">crdemo.conf</span> - this is the configuration
          described above. One application node is connected (via a
          <span class="SPU">pack</span> or <span class="SPU">tilesort</span>
          SPU) to one <span class="crApp">crserver</span> node which has a
          <span class="SPU">render</span> SPU.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span class="File">local.conf</span> - this configuration
          demonstrates OpenGL command filtering. A single application node has
          a <span class="SPU">hiddenline</span> SPU and a <span class=
          "SPU">render</span> SPU. The <span class="SPU">hiddenline</span> SPU
          manipulates the OpenGL command stream to render the demo program's
          geometry in an outline mode.

        <p>
          <span class="File">psubmit_last.conf</span> - a demonstration of
          sort-last parallel rendering. Two application nodes, each with a
          <span class="SPU">readback</span> SPU, render part of the scene. The
          partial renderings are sent by pack SPUs to the final <span class=
          "crApp">crserver</span> node's <span class="SPU">render</span> SPU
          where the images are Z-composited together. The demo can be modified
          to use more than two application instances.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

          <span class="SPU">render</span> SPU's ability to render back into the
          application's window (on X only; not Windows). The application node
          uses a <span class="SPU">tilesort</span> SPU to talk to two
          <span class="crApp">crserver</span>s. Each <span class=
          "crApp">crserver</span> has a <span class="SPU">readback</span> SPU.
          The <span class="SPU">readback</span> SPUs render into the original
          application window, rather than separate windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          This configuration also demonstrates dynamic retiling. When the
          application window is resized, the <span class="SPU">tilesort</span>
          SPU's tiling is changed.
