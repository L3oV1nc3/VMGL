      Adding OpenGL Extensions to Chromium
    </h1>
    <p>
      In order to use particular OpenGL extensions in your OpenGL application,
      Chromium must also implement those extensions. This page describes how
      OpenGL extensions are implemented in Chromium and how to add new ones.

      Compile-time extension support
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <span class="File">include/cr_versions.h</span> file defines a
      preprocessor token for each extension Chromium supports. For example:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      #define CR_ARB_multitexture 1<br>
      #define CR_ARB_texture_cube_map 1<br>
      #define CR_EXT_blend_color 1<br>
      #define CR_EXT_blend_minmax 1<br>
      #define CR_EXT_blend_subtract 1<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Chromium client programs are ordinary OpenGL applications and should
      use the <code>GL_</code>-prefixed tokens to test for extensions. However,
      Chromium-specific applications may use these tokens if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Internally, Chromium uses these tokens to determine which OpenGL
      extensions should be enabled. If one wants to disable a particular
      extension in Chromium you can simply comment-out the appropriate
      <code>#define</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When adding a new extension to chromium you should surround all the new
      code for that extension with <code>#ifdef CR_(extension name)</code> and
      <code>#endif</code>.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Run-time extension support
    </h2>
    <p>
      At runtime, Chromium clients should use
      <code>glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS)</code> to determine if extensions are
      supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      Internally, Chromium will compute the extension string by examining the
      extensions supported by each back-end OpenGL implementation, finding the
      intersection, and propogating the list up through the SPU DAG to be sure
      the extensions are supported by all the Chromium SPUs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extension strings and OpenGL limits like maximum texture size and number
      of light sources for each SPU are stored in the mothership. When each SPU
      is initialized it reports its OpenGL extensions and limits to the
      mothership. Some SPUs, like the tilesort SPU, will query the mothership
      for its children/server SPU limits in order to determine its own limits.
    </p>

      Adding new extensions
    </h2>
    <p>
      Here are the steps for adding a new extension to Chromium:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Add a new <code>CR_</code>* token to <span class=
      "File">include/cr_versions.h</span>.
      </li>
      <li>Add a new GLboolean field to the <code>CRExtensionState</code>
      structure in the <span class="File">include/state/cr_limits.h</span>
      file.
      </li>
      <li>Add new code in <code class="Function">crStateExtensionsInit</code>
      in <span class="File">spu/state_tracker/state_limits.c</span> to
      initialize the new boolean. Update the extension strings in
        <span class="File">state_tracker/state_limits.c</span> as well.
      </li>
      <li>Implement the new code for the extension as needed throughout
      Chromium. Specifically, the packer, unpacker and state tracker are the
      major modules which need updating. The best advice here is to look at
      existing extensions for ideas.
      </li>
      <li>Extensions which only add new tokens to existing functions are
      easiest to implement. Often, only the state tracker needs to be updated.
      </li>
      <li>Extensions which add new OpenGL functions are more work. The file
      <span class="File">glapi_parser/APIspec.txt</span> defines all the OpenGL
      API functions (entry points). New extension functions should be added to
      this file, following the example of others. Read the information at the
      top of the file first.
      </li>
      <li>The code for new extensions should be surrounded by <code>#ifdef
      CR_(extension_name)</code> and <code>#endif</code> so that it can be
      disabled if desired. See the <code>GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_ARB</code> clause
      in <code class="Function">__enableSet()</code> in <span class=
      "File">spu/state_tracker/state_enable.c</span> for an example.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Application-only extensions
    </h2>
    <p>
      A short-cut to adding new extensions is to implment them for the
      application-side only. This means that the extension can only be used by
      SPUs running on the application node (such as the render SPU or readback
      SPU when using a sort-last configuration). An examples of an
      application-only extension is GL_NV_fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, only the OpenGL API dispatcher needs to be updated. The
      extension should be added to the <code>__stateAppOnlyExtensions</code>
      string in <span class="File">state_tracker/state_limits.c</span>.
