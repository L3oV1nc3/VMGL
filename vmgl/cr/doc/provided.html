      This section describes the major components of Chromium and how they fit
      together.

          The configuration mothership
        </p>
        <p class="ProvidedDesc">
          The mothership handles all configuration requests for all components
          of the system. The mothership is written in python and can be found

          The <span class="Directory">mothership/configs</span> directory

          A "render" SPU
        </p>
        <p class="ProvidedDesc">
          This SPU hands all OpenGL calls to the system's OpenGL
          implementation. Nearly every Chromium configuration will use the
          <span class="SPU">render</span> SPU (or <span class=

          A "pack" SPU
        </p>
        <p class="ProvidedDesc">
          This SPU packs a stream of OpenGL commands into a buffer which is
          sent over the network to a <em>network server node</em>. Although the
          calls are encoded verbatim (i.e., with no analysis), some state
          tracking is still necessary in order to properly unpack pixel data
          for texture maps.

          An OpenGL replacement / faker library
        </p>
        <p class="ProvidedDesc">
          This library "fakes" unmodified applications into using Chromium. The
          main thing that the faker library does is to load the client-side
          SPUs and dispatch OpenGL calls to the first SPU in the chain.
          Although SPUs implement the OpenGL interface, they typically only
          export a very small number of symbols. The SPU loader will create a
          collection of function pointers for the SPUs functions. The
          replacement library is necessary to actually resemble the system's
          OpenGL interface sufficiently to broker requests from applications to
          SPUs. Note that an application could easily load a SPU from disk
          itself and use it without the OpenGL library, which would be one
          possible way to render to a local screen and over a network
          simultaneously.

          The launcher, called <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span>, launches
          applications in a special way that causes them to load the OpenGL
          replacement library rather than the system's library.<br>
          The application launcher is usually refered to as an <em>application
          node</em>. Application nodes and <em>server/network nodes</em> host
          SPU chains.

          This server, called <span class="CrApp">crserver</span>, is
          responsible for dispatching incoming blocks of encoded OpenGL
          commands (such as from the <span class="SPU">pack</span> SPU) to a
          chain of SPUs. In fact, as we will see, the network server is really
          a stream <em>serializer</em>. It is the job of the server to accept
          streams from multiple clients, and context switch between them as
          allowed by the <a href="parallelapplication.html">parallel API
          extensions</a>. In addition, a server can manage multiple display
          tiles, and is responsible for re-decoding a block of work multiple
          times, with appropriate modifications to the viewing matrices for
          multiple tiles.<br>
          The <span class="CrApp">crserver</span> is otherwise known as a

      Other SPUs

    <p>
      In addition to the SPUs shown so far, several more are provided. Some of
      the SPUs are intended to be used directly in a configuration graph, and
      others are more useful as starting points for new SPUs, or SPUs to

          The "dist_texture" SPU
        </p>
        <p class="ProvidedDesc">
          This SPU allows you to have texture images saved to disk on nodes
          running crserver processes. The textures can later be loaded by
          specifying only the filename, thus avoiding the network traffic cost
          of sending the entire image. This is accomplished by intercepting
          <code class="Function">glTexImage2D</code> calls and checking the
          value of the <code>type</code> parameter. If it is
          <code>GL_TRUE</code>, then the texture data (in the
          <code>pixels</code> parameter) is assumed to be a
          <code>NULL</code>-terminated filename string followed by texture data
          of the given width and height (which need not be powers of two). The
          image data must be interleaved RGB values in
          <code>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</code> format and will be written to disk as a
          raw PPM image. Once the file is written, the image will be padded if
          necessary (so that the width and height are powers of two) and sent
          downstream as a valid <code class="Function">glTexImage2D</code>
          call. If the <code>type</code> parameter is <code>GL_FALSE</code>,
          then the <code>pixels</code> parameter is assumed to be the filename
          of a raw PPM image file which will be read, padded if necessary, and
          sent downstream as a valid <code class="Function">glTexImage2D</code>
          call. This extension to <code class="Function">glTexImage2D</code>
          was developed for the <a href=
          "http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/TechFocus/Deployment/DBox/Doc/PixelBlaster.html">
          NCSA Pixel Blaster</a> (a movie player for tiled displays), which is
          a good example of its use. Unlike the original NCSA modifications to
          WireGL, the distributed texture SPU does not ban absolute filenames
          because Chromium's crserver processes are meant to be started by the
          same user who is running the application. The original WireGL
          modifications were by <a href="mailto:prajlich@ncsa.uiuc.edu">Paul
          Rajlich</a>, but don't bug him about this version; all the bugs are

          This SPU will issue a fatal error on any OpenGL call. The error
          message will contain the name of the function called. This SPU is
          useful for handling "impossible" function calls. If the reader is
          already familiar with <a href="newspu.html">SPU inheritance</a>, all

        <p class="ProvidedDesc">
          This SPU will catch all related Feedback and Selection OpenGL calls.
          This allows the abstraction of this layer away from other SPUs. If
          you need support for Feedback and Selection, then insert this SPU
          into the chain.

          This SPU will silently discard all OpenGL calls. This SPU is most
          useful for understanding the performance of applications and cluster
          configurations. By replacing the <span class="SPU">render</span> SPU
          with the <span class="SPU">nop</span> SPU, time spent actually
          executing OpenGL commands can be eliminated. Similarly, the
          <span class="SPU">nop</span> SPU can be used on the client to make
          all OpenGL calls "free". This helps establish a baseline for
          performance.

          This SPU will pass all calls to the next SPU in a chain. Note that it
          can therefore never appear as the last SPU in a chain (this is a
          checked, fatal error). This SPU is not useful by itself, but it is a
          very useful SPU to inherit from in order to implement a subset of the
          OpenGL API. An example of such a SPU is shown in the "<a href=

          a human-readable dump of all OpenGL calls, either to standard output
          (default), or to a file. This is an invaluable tool for debugging,
          although it does have a fairly serious impact on performance. Some
          attempt is also made to turn <code>GLenum</code> types back into
          human-readable strings (thanks to <a href=

          This SPU is derived from the <span class="SPU">render</span> SPU. As

          window. When <code class="Function">SwapBuffers</code> is called,
          however, the color buffer image is sent to the child SPU via
          <code class="Function">glDrawPixels</code>. Optionally, the depth (Z)
          buffer image is also sent to the child SPU. By sending the color and
          depth images from several <span class="SPU">readback</span> SPUs to
          one <span class="SPU">render</span> SPU, one can implement a

          This SPU saves the current frame to a JPEG or PPM file. Just like the
          <span class="SPU">print</span> SPU, this SPU can be very useful for
          debugging streams. It uses its downstream child to do a <code class=
          "Function">ReadPixels</code>, so this SPU can never be the last one
          in the chain. (It also might require a <span class=

          tested.)

          This SPU actually implements no functions (it is therefore exactly
          equivalent to the <span class="SPU">SPU</span>, due to the implicit
          inheritance). However, a script is provided to rename all files and
          update the source code to create a new SPU of a given name.
          Therefore, when creating a new SPU, a copy should be made of the
          <span class="Directory">spu/template</span> directory, and this
          script should be run. This is the approach used in the <a href=

      Useful libraries

          An "application stub" library for Chromium-aware applications

        <p class="ProvidedDesc">
          This library can be used by Chromium-aware applications that wish,
          for instance, to use the Parallel API. It also provides routines for
          creating an OpenGL context without ever opening a window, a useful
          thing for a distributed application to do (since it doesn't
          necessarily make sense for dozens of blank faked-out client windows
          to spring up all over the cluster, especially when all of your
          cluster nodes aren't running X-Windows). This approach is preferred
          over defining the Chromium-specific functions as OpenGL extensions
          and using something like <code class=
          "Function">wglGetProcAddress</code> to extract the function pointers,
          since the application stub library is portable and applications don't

          Applications that need to talk to the configuration mothership will

          A packer library for packing OpenGL commands into network buffers
        </p>
        <p class="ProvidedDesc">
          This library provides a "packing" function for each OpenGL function.
          When such a function is called, the function arguments and an opcode
          are packed into a buffer for eventual transmission. Although this
          library exports a full OpenGL interface, it is not really a SPU. In
          particular, the packing functions for OpenGL calls requiring pixel
          data (e.g., <code class="Function">glTexImage2D</code>) require
          additional arguments detailing the unpacking state. For an example of
          this usage, see <span class="File">spu/pack/pack_pixel.c</span>.
          Currently, this library is used by both the <span class=

          by the OpenGL stub library and the server, applications can load SPUs
          explicitly if they wish.

          A library for tracking OpenGL state
        </p>
        <p class="ProvidedDesc">
          This library provides the necessary functionality to track the
          complete OpenGL graphics state. This library is quite complex, both
          because the OpenGL state is large and intricate, and also because it
          contains the logic for doing differencing between contexts. Graphics
          contexts are represented with "hierarchical dirty bits" so that they
          can be compared extremely efficiently, a frequent operation when
          updating a tiled display or switching between contexts on the server.
          This library does most of the OpenGL error checking, and satisfies
          <code class="Function&quot;">glGet*</code> requests locally. For a
          description of the techniques used by this library, see our <a href=

      Other programs

    <p>
      A few small programs are built as part off the Chromium build process.
      They won't all be listed here, as many of them are small test or demo
      programs.

          resetms

        <p class="ProvidedDesc">
          This program resets the mothership to its initial state. Because
          multiple applications or servers could run on one computer (called,
          say, "sluff"), the mothership remembers when it has been contacted by
          a server running on "sluff", so the next time a server running on
          "sluff" identifies itself, the mothership knows which one it is. This
          means that after a Chromium run, the mothership is in an unusable
          state, since it will no longer accept server connections from
          "sluff". Running resetms will destroy all of the mothership's
          internal state. This is generally preferable to quitting the
          mothership and starting it again, especially since the socket isn't
          always properly released, which will prevent the mothership from
          starting up on its default port for a minute or two.

          This is just about the simplest example of a parallel OpenGL program.
          Instance "1" of this program will draw a blue triangle, and instance
          "2" of this program will draw a green triangle. With the right config
          script (see <span class="File">mothership/configs/psubmit.conf</span>
          for an example), this program can be used to verify that the server's
          parallel API synchronization primitives are working and that parallel
          submission is, in theory, possible.

      Most of the other programs that are built are designed to exercise one
      particular portion of the system. Some of them are contributed by WireGL
      users (thanks in particular to Peter Kirchner for providing some VERY
      stripped down programs that trip a bug), and there are a number of
      programs that each demonstrate the functionality of a single OpenGL
      extension, thanks to <a href="http://www.ccntech.com" target=
      "_parent">Chris Niederauer</a> (all found in the <span class=
      "Directory">progs/extensions/*</span> directories). Run them. Show off
      anisotropic texture filtering on your display wall, it's fun.

      Miscellany
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Chromium distribution contains some other useful stuff that isn't a
      SPU, library, or program:

          A pretty slick build system
        </p>
        <p class="ProvidedDesc">
          Chromium's build system is mainly designed to achieve two goals.
          First, creating a new Makefile for a library or program should be as
          simple as possible. Second, it should be possible to build the code
          on multiple operating systems from the same network-mounted drive
          without any object files or dependencies conflicting with each other.
          Users who want to port Chromium to a new system will need to create a
          new make-system-configuration file in <span class=
          "Directory">config/</span>, most likely just using one of the
          existing files as a template. The build will also quit with an error
          on various system-dependent things in the "utility" library, such as
          the abstraction for DLLs, etc. The build system also includes a very
          fast perl-based C/C++ dependency generator due to <a href=
          "http://graphics.stanford.edu/~eldridge" target="_parent">Matthew
          Eldridge</a> in <span class="File">scripts/fastdep.pl</span>. This
          was rewritten in Python by <a href=
          "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/~crw7/" target="_parent">Christopher
          Waters</a> to remove the Perl requirements from Chromium.

        <p class="ProvidedDesc">
          The scripts in <span class="Directory">glapi_parser/</span> parse a
          massaged version of the Windows OpenGL header, and also a
          Chromium-specific header containing our supported extension functions
          (e.g., <code class="Function">glBlendColorEXT</code>, <code class=
          "Function">glBarrierExecCR</code>, etc). This parsed representation
          is used by almost every component of the system to automatically
          generate some or all of their code.

        <p class="ProvidedDesc">
          The routines available in <span class=
          "File">opengl_stub/stub_common.py</span> are available for use by any
          Python script that is generating Chromium code. It is used quite
          heavily throughout most of the system. In particular, it provides a
          very easy way to tag certain OpenGL functions as "special". For
          example, many of the OpenGL packing functions can be auto-generated,
          but some (like <code class="Function">glMaterialfv</code>) are more
          complicated and need to be coded by hand. The complex functions can
          simply be listed in a separate file, and the contents of that file
          efficiently examined through the API exposed by these Python
          routines.
