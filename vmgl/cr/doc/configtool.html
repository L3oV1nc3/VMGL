      Graphical Configuration Tool
    </h1>
    <p>
      The Chromium graphical configuration tool (hereafter called the config
      tool) allows one to build a Chromium configuration with a GUI-based
      interface, instead of writing Python configuration files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a screenshot showing a simple tile-sort configuration:

    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Setup
    </h2>
    <p>
      The config tool is written in Python and uses the wxWindows GUI toolkit.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a Linux system, you'll need the wxGTK and wxPython libraries. If
      you're using Red Hat Linux the <span class="File">wxGTK-2.3.2-1</span>
      and <span class="File">wxPython-2.3.2.1-1</span> RPMs are known to work.
      Alternately, the <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10718" target=
      "_parent">wxPythonGTK-py2.2 RPM</a> is reported to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a Windows system, you'll need the wxPythonWIN32 libraries only. The
      <span class="File">wxPythonWIN32-23.3.1-Py22.exe</span> file is known to
      work, albeit some of the buttons are not positioned correctly and are
      obscured.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE: If you are using the Cygwin environment, you must specify the PATH
      to the real Win32 versions of Python 2.2.x so that the correct wxPython
      libraries are used before the cygwin parts.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Running the Config Tool
    </h2>
    <p>
      The config tool is in the <span class="Directory">mothership/tools</span>
      directory. Run it by typing <span class="Command">python
      configtool.py</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      You may optionally specify a Chromium configuration file to read
      immediately.<br>
      For example: <span class="Command">python configtool.py
      ../configs/crdemo.conf</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Note to Unix users: If you set the executable flag on configtool.py with
      <span class="Command">chmod a+x configtool.py</span> you'll be able to
      run the program directly, without invoking python directly.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Configuration Files
    </h2>
    <p>
      The config tool reads and writes Python-based configuration files like
      the examples given in <span class="Directory">mothership/configs</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you've made a configuration file, you can try it out with Chromium
      as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="Command">python configfile.conf [program]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      where <span class="Command">[program]</span> is the name of the
      application to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="#templates">templates section</a> has more information about
      command-line options for configuration files.
    </p>
    <p>
      The config tool is also very useful for visualizing arbitrary
      configuration files. Chromium configurations can be complicated and
      rather difficult to understand. You may find that loading configuration
      files into the config tool will help you to quickly understand how they
      work.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      A Chromium configuration is basically a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The
      graph's nodes are displayed as boxes and the edges (network connections)
      are drawn as lines. With the graphical configuration tool you can add,
      remove and edit nodes and edges with a graphical interface, instead of
      editing the text-based Python configuration file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, a new configuration will be created with a <a href=
      "#templates">template</a>. Alternately, a configuration can be built from
      scratch by creating nodes, adding SPUs to the nodes, connecting the nodes
      and setting various configuration options.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Nodes
    </h2>
    <p>
      Application nodes are represented by green boxes and network/server nodes
      are represented by red boxes. Each node icon may contain an SPU chain,
      shown as a sequence of gray boxes. Nodes and SPUs are labeled
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Application and network/server nodes may be created with the <span class=
      "Button">New App Node(s)</span> and <span class="Button">New Server
      Node(s)</span> buttons. You can create 1, 2, 3, 4 or N instances of
      either type of node.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nodes may be selected and moved using the mouse. Selected nodes have a
      thick black outline. You may extend the selection by
      <em>shift-clicking</em>. You can toggle the selection status of a node by
      <em>control-clicking</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="MenuItem">Node</span> menu has commands that apply to
      the currently selected nodes. Most are self-explanatory, some are
      described in more detail below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Compound nodes</em> are a compact way to represent a set of many
      similar nodes. For example, if your configuration has 8 rendering nodes,
      you may represent them using a single compound node, rather than 8
      individual nodes. A compound node looks like this:
    </p>
    <p class="Center">
      <img src="compoundnode.gif" class="noborder">
    </p>
    <p>
      The compound node displays a count which indicates how may nodes are
      represented by the icon. You can change the count with the <span class=
      "MenuItem">Node / Node Count</span> menu item. Compount nodes may be
      split into a set of individual, non-compound nodes with the <span class=
      "MenuItem">Node / Split</span> menu item. A set of similar, individual
      nodes may be combined into a compound node with the <span class=
      "MenuItem">Node / Merge</span> menu item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nodes have hostnames to indicate the computer on which they run. The
      hostname can be set for the selected nodes with the <span class=
      "MenuItem">Node / Host Name</span> menu item. The following dialog will
      appear:
    </p>
    <p class="Center">
      <img src="hostname_dialog.gif" class="noborder">
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two sections to the dialog:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <em>Generate Host Names</em> - this section lets you easily generate a
        sequence of numbered hostnames. If the pattern string contains a #
        symbol, the # will be replaced by an index. The first index and number
        of names to generate are set with the <span class="DialogItem">First
        Index</span> and <span class=
        "&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt; controls. Click on &lt;span class=">Generate</span>
        to generate the hostnames.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Edit Host Names</em> - in this section you can select a host name,
        move it up or down in the list, delete it or rename it using the
        buttons in the upper-right corner of the list.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When finished, choose <span class="Button">OK</span> or <span class=
      "Button">Cancel</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="MenuItem">Edit</span> menu has <span class=
      "MenuItem">Cut</span>, <span class="MenuItem">Copy</span>, and
      <span class="MenuItem">Paste</span> commands. These are useful for moving
      parts of configuration graphs between two projects.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      SPUs
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nodes contain SPU chains. SPU chains are seen as one or more gray,
      labeled boxes inside node icons.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add a new SPU to a node, first select the node, then choose the SPU
      type from the <span class="Button">New SPU</span> button. If no SPUs are
      currently selected in the node, the new SPU will be added to the end of
      the SPU chain. If one or more SPUs are currently selected in the node,
      the new SPU will be added in front of the first selected SPU.
    </p>
    <p>
      If several nodes are selected, the SPU will be added to all selected
      nodes. If the SPU can't be added for any reason, you'll be informed why.
      For example, no SPU can be added after a <span class="SPU">pack</span>
      SPU or <span class="SPU">tilesort</span> SPU.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with nodes, SPUs may be selected and deselected by clicking on them
      with the mouse. The <em>shift</em> and <em>control</em> keys may be used
      while clicking to extend and toggle selection status, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="MenuItem">SPU</span> menu has commands that apply to the
      currently selected SPUs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="MenuItem">SPU / Options</span> menu item will open a
      dialog which allows you to configure the selected SPUs. If more than one
      SPU is selected, all selected SPUs must be of the same type. The new SPU
      settings will be applied to all selected SPUs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are the options for the <span class="SPU">render</span> SPU:
    </p>
    <p class="Center">
      <img src="renderspu_options.gif" class="noborder">
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="Button">Restore Defaults</span> button will reset all
      options to their default values
    </p>
    <p>
      Documentation for SPU options can be found in the section <a href=
      "configoptions.html">Configuration Options for Provided SPUs</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Client / Server Connections
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some SPUs (such as <span class="SPU">pack</span> and <span class=
      "SPU">tilesort</span>) have a packer which allows them to be connected to
      downstream servers. Such SPUs have a black, rectangular <em>socket</em>
      on their right edge. Similarly, servers have a black, rectangular
      <em>socket</em> on their left edge. Connections between packing SPUs and
      servers are drawn as blue lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      To connect nodes (i.e. connect a packing SPU to a server node) use the
      <span class="MenuItem">Node / Connect</span> menu item. You must have at
      least two nodes selected, one must be a server and the other must have an
      SPU chain that ends with a packing SPU.
    </p>
    <p>
      If more than two SPUs are selected, the configuration tool will do its
      best to determine the desired connection topology, but it may make
      mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nodes may be disconnected by selecting the nodes and choosing the
      <span class="MenuItem">Node / Disconnect</span> menu item.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Application Node Options
    </h2>
    <p>
      Application nodes can be configured by selecting them and then choosing
      <span class="MenuItem">App Node Options</span> from the <span class=
      "MenuItem">Node</span> menu. When you chose it, the following dialog
      appears:
    </p>
    <p class="Center">
      <img src="appoptions_dialog.gif" class="noborder">
    </p>
    <p>
      The three fields labeled <span class="DialogItem">Command</span>,
      <span class="DialogItem">Zeroth arg</span>, and <span class=
      "DialogItem">Start Directory</span> control execution of the application
      program.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="DialogItem">Command</span> specifies the the default program
      and command line arguments to run with this configuration. There are
      three special substitutions that may be made:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>%N will be replaced by the number of application nodes.
      </li>
      <li>%I will be replaced by the index of the application node, starting
      with zero.
      </li>
      <li>%0 will be replaced by a the <span class="DialogItem">Zeroth
      arg</span>, if specified.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These substitutions are useful for multi-client configurations. Suppose,
      for example, that you're using a sort-last configuration with 4
      application/rendering nodes and want to run the psubmit demo program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The command would be <span class="Command">psubmit -size %N -rank %I
      -clear %0</span> and the zeroth argument would be <span class=
      "Command">-swap</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, the four instances of the application nodes would be run
      with the following command lines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>App node 0: <span class="Command">psubmit -size 4 -rank 0 -clear
      -swap</span>
      </li>
      <li>App node 1: <span class="Command">psubmit -size 4 -rank 1
      -clear</span>
      </li>
      <li>App node 2: <span class="Command">psubmit -size 4 -rank 2
      -clear</span>
      </li>
      <li>App node 3: <span class="Command">psubmit -size 4 -rank 3
      -clear</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <span class="DialogItem">Start Directory</span> parameter specifies
      the directory in which the <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span> should
      be started. This will be the application's current working directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="DialogItem">Client DLL</span> parameter specifies the
      directory to search to find the <em>faker</em> library.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="DialogItem">SPU Directory</span> parameter specifies the
      directory to search when loading SPUs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="DialogItem">Minimum Chromium App Window Size</span> and
      <span class="DialogItem">Match App Window Title</span> controls are
      useful for multi-context/window applications. They're described in the
      <a href="configapp.html">application node configuration</a> section.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the <span class="DialogItem">Track App Window Size Changes</span>
      control is checked, Chromium will monitor the size of the original
      application window and tell down stream Chromium SPUs to adjust their
      window sizes whenever the application window is resized.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the <span class="DialogItem">Show Virtual Cursor</span> control is
      checked, Chromium will monitor the current mouse pointer position in the
      application window and draw a virtual cursor in the Chromium <span class=
      "SPU">render</span> SPU windows. This is useful for interactive
      application that have direct manipulation.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Server Node Options
    </h2>
    <p>
      Server nodes can be configured by selecting them and then choosing
      <span class="MenuItem">Server Node Options</span> from the <span class=
      "MenuItem">Node</span> menu. When you chose it, the following dialog
      appears:
    </p>
    <p class="Center">
      <img src="serveroptions_dialog.gif" class="noborder">
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="DialogItem">Optimized Extent Bucketing</span> control is
      used when there are two or more images tiles present in the server node's
      rendering window. A special hash-based algorithm will be used to
      determine which tiles a primitive intersects. If option offers improved
      server performance, but all tiles must be the same size.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="DialogItem">Generate Lightning-2 Strip Headers</span>
      option is for use with the Lightning-2 hardware image compositor. It
      controls whether special compositing codes are embedded in 2-pixel wide
      columns between tiles. (currently not implemented in the server)
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="DialogItem">Only swap once for N clients</span> option
      is useful for sort-last rendering, or when a server has several clients.
      When enabled, OpenGL SwapBuffer commands will only be executed for one of
      the N client nodes. If all clients were to do a SwapBuffers, the image
      would flicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="DialogItem">SPU Directory</span> parameter specifies the
      directory to search when loading SPUs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enabling <span class="DialogItem">Debug/Log Barrier/Semaphor Calls</span>
      will cause diagnostic messages to be printed when glBarrierCreateCR,
      glBarrierCreateCR, glSemaphoreExecCR, glSemaphorePCR and glSemaphoreVCR
      are called. This may be useful for debugging parallel applications.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Mothership Options
    </h2>
    <p>
      Choosing <span class="MenuItem">Options</span> from the <span class=
      "MenuItem">Mothership</span> menu opens the mothership options dialog.
      There are only two controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="DialogItem">Max Transmission Unit</span> controls the
      maximum buffer sized used for inter-node communication, in bytes. The
      default is 1MB.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="DialogItem">Automatically Start Servers</span> option,
      when enabled, will cause the mothership to automatically spawn
      <span class="CrApp">crserver</span> and <span class=
      "CrApp">crappfaker</span> processes for each node (currently limited to
      sh and rsh on Unix). This means you don't have to manually start these
      processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="DialogItem">Number of Nodes per Thread</span> and
      <span class="DialogItem">Number of Thread Branches</span> options control
      when the mothership will create extra threads when automatically spawning
      <span class="CrApp">crserver</span> and <span class=
      "CrApp">crappfaker</span> processes for each node. If the <span class=
      "DialogItem">Number of Thread Branches</span> value is zero (the default)
      or one, all external processes will be sequentially spawned in a single
      thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the <span class="DialogItem">Number of Thread Branches</span> value is
      two or more, it specifies how many new subthreads will be created within
      the mothership to help spawn node processes, whenever there are more
      nodes than the number specified in the <span class="DialogItem">Max
      Number of Nodes per Thread</span> option. If new subthreads are created,
      the node list is evenly partitioned to the new subthreads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this process is recursive: if new threads are created, but
      those threads have too many nodes to handle, they will in turn create
      more subthreads to handle the nodes, until each thread is handling the
      number of nodes specified in <span class="DialogItem">Max Number of Nodes
      per Thread</span> or fewer. This can geometrically increase the number of
      threads used in the mothership, but typically only for a very short time
      (i.e. only long enough to create processes).
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Mothership Run / Stop
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <span class="MenuItem">Mothership</span> menu has <span class=
      "MenuItem">Run</span> and <span class="MenuItem">Stop</span> items. The
      <span class="MenuItem">Run</span> item will spawn the Chromium mothership
      as a new process. The <span class="MenuItem">Stop</span> item will kill
      the spawned mothership.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the mothership option to automatically start crservers and crappfakers
      is enabled, your Chromium configuration and application should run
      automatically. Otherwise, you'll have to start the crserver and
      crappfaker processes yourself, as this option <em>only</em> directly
      spawns the mothership.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      <a name="templates" id="templates">Templates</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Templates allow one to quickly create common Chromium configurations
      without having to create individual nodes, SPUs and connections. To
      instantiate a template, choose the desired template from the <span class=
      "Button">New Template</span> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you instantiate a template you'll often be prompted for a few
      parameters such as number of application nodes, mural rows and columns,
      etc. The configuration will be generated when you click on the
      <span class="Button">OK</span> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Templates may be edited with special, easy-to-use dialogs. Click on the
      <span class="Button">Edit Template</span> button to open the editor, if
      supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, there are three templates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="tilesort_template.html">tile-sort</a> - sort-first tiled
        rendering typically used to drive large mural displays.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="sortlast_template.html">sort-last</a> - parallel rendering
        with per-pixel image compositing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="reassembly_template.html">image reassembly</a> - sort-first
        tiled rendering with image reassembly.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Chromium configuration tool may be extended with new types of
      templates (it's a modular interface). A template for binary-swap image
      composition is likely.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Hardware Description File
    </h2>
    <p>
      The config tool looks for a special hardware description file when a
      template is created. This file contains cluster host names, the mural
      size, screen sizes, etc. If you set up this file, it'll save you some
      time when designing a new Chromium configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a sample of the file:

      The file format can be directly parsed by Python (it's a dictionary which
      maps configuration option names to values.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, we set the following parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>mural_size</code> - this defines the size of your mural display
        in terms of columns and rows of screens. In this case, there are two
        rows of two screens.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>screen_size</code> - this indicates that each screen of each
        rendering host is 1280 x 1024 pixels in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>tile_size</code> - for a tile-reassembly configuration (such as
        used with Lightning-2) this indicates the default tile size in pixels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>frontend_hosts</code> - this list contains the host names of the
        client workstations. Usually, there's only one name in this list. In a
        typical tile-sort configuration, this will be the application host. In
        a sort-last configuration, this would be the host that displays the
        composited image.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>cluster_hosts</code> - this list contains the names of the
        systems in the rendering cluster. In this example there are four hosts,
        which corresponds to the 2 by 2 mural size.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>cluster_pattern</code> - this tuple describes the naming
        convention for the cluster. In this example, the hostnames start with
        the prefix "cr" and end with a number. The first host is number 1. Some
        sites may number their hosts starting at zero. The
        <code>cluster_hosts</code> parameter has priority over the
        <code>cluster_pattern</code> parameter if both are set.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All the parameters are optional. The config tool will use built-in
      defaults if any of these fields aren't set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, this file is named <span class="File">chromium.crsite</span>
      and should be in the directory which the config tool is started. The name
      and location of this file may change in the future.
