      Configuration Scripts
    </h1>
    <p>
      Unlike many distributed systems, Chromium is configured in only one
      place. The <em>configuration mothership</em> is a network service that
      responds to configuration queries from Chromium nodes, so all
      configuration for an entire cluster run can be managed in one place. In
      addition, Chromium configuration is not specified in static files, but
      rather it is specified programmatically using the <a href=
      "http://www.python.org/" target="_parent">Python</a> programming
      language. If you're not familiar with Python, don't worry, you can almost
      always create a new configuration script from an existing one without
      really understanding the semantics of the language. In WireGL, we were
      always writing homegrown parameterized scripts to generate configuration
      files; in Chromium, the script <em>is</em> the configuration file.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Chromium configuration script basically builds a graph which describes
      how OpenGL commands flow from the application node(s) to the server
      node(s). Application and server nodes host SPUs which process and filter
      the OpenGL command steram. The graph is a DAG (directed acyclic graph).
      To get a better feel for the layout of configuration graphs, take a look
      at the figures shown in the <a href="configtool.html">graphical
      configuration tool section</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at the <a href="crdemo.conf" target="_parent" class=
      "File">crdemo.conf</a> script that drove the <a href=
      "helloworld.html">Hello, World</a> demo. You should be viewing this
      configuration script while reading the description below.
    </p>
    <table border="0" width="100%" class="CodeFrame">
      <tr>
        <td width="7%" class="LineNumbers">
          6:<br>
          7:<br>
          8:
        </td>
        <td width="93%" class="CodeListing">
          import sys<br>
          sys.path.append( '../server' )<br>
          from mothership import *
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      These three lines will appear at the top of every configuration script.
      Lines 1 and 2 are Python jargon that allow the interpreter to search
      another directory for imported modules. In this case, the module
      <code class="Class">mothership</code> loaded in line 3 is located in the
      <span class="Directory">cr/mothership/server</span> directory. Line 3
      imports all of the symbols from the <code class="Class">mothership</code>
      Python module. We say "<code>from mothership import *</code>" instead of
      "<code>import mothership</code>" so that we can refer to elements of the
      mothership module without explicitly qualifying their names. For example,
      later we will see references to <code class="Class">SPU</code> objects,
      which would be <code class="Class">mothership.SPU</code> objects had we
      not done our import this way.
    </p>
    <table border="0" width="100%" class="CodeFrame">
      <tr>
        <td width="7%" class="LineNumbers">
          10:<br>

    </table>
    <p>
      Thise lines make sure that the arguments to the script are correct.
      Recall that this script determines which program to run by its first
      argument, so "<code>sys.argv</code>" (analogous to the
      "<code>argv</code>" parameter to "<code class="Function">main</code>" in
      C/C++) must have at least two elements (including the name of the
      script). This script can take an optional third argument specifying the
      SPU to be loaded by the client node. Notice, by the way, that Python
      delimits blocks by indentation only; there are no curly braces or
      "<code>endif</code>"s to mark the end of things. Be extremely careful
      about mixing tabs and spaces (i.e., don't do it).

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Line 14 assigns "demo" the first script argument, or the name of the
      program to be run. This, for example, would hold the value "fonttest" in
      the <a href="helloworld.html">Hello, World</a> example.

    <p>
      Lines 16-19 figure out which SPU will be loaded by the application. If
      the user has specified three arguments to the script, then the third one
      will be the name of the spu. Otherwise, it defaults to "<span class=
      "SPU">pack</span>".

    <table border="0" width="100%" class="CodeFrame">

    <p>
      Lines 21-22 create <code class="Class">SPU</code> objects. These are the
      plug-in modules that implement the OpenGL API. In the <a href=
      "helloworld.html">Hello, World</a> example, we created two SPUs: a
      <span class="SPU">render</span> SPU that dispatches OpenGL calls to the
      system's implementation, and a <span class="SPU">pack</span> SPU that
      encodes its commands and sends them over the network verbatim (i.e., with
      [almost] no analysis). Each SPU in a system needs to have a separate
      <code class="Class">SPU</code> object created for it in the configuration
      script. Notice that we are using the client SPU name that was computed in
      lines 16-19.
    </p>
    <table border="0" width="100%" class="CodeFrame">
      <tr>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Once the SPUs are created, they can be configured. In this case, the
      <span class="SPU">render</span> SPU needs to know what kind of window to
      create. This directive tells the <span class="SPU">render</span> SPU to
      create a window that is 500 pixels wide and 500 pixels high, and is shown
      at an offset of (100,100) from the upper-left corner of the screen. This
      is all the SPU configuration that happens in this script, because the
      client SPU needs no configuration. A complete list of all available
      configuration parameters for all provided SPUs is given in the "<a href=
      "configoptions.html">Configuration options for Provided SPUs</a>"
      section.

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Once all the SPUs have been defined and configured, it's now time to
      describe the graph of nodes itself. The server node is created as an
      instance of a <code class="Class">CRNetworkNode</code> object. Notice
      that no parameters are given to the constructor for this object. There
      are two optional parameters that can be passed to the constructor: a
      "hostname" parameter indicating the name of the computer on which this
      node will be running, and a "port" parameter indicating what port it
      should listen on for clients. If no hostname is provided, the default is
      'localhost'. The default port is 7000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each node can have a <em>chain</em> of SPUs attached to it. The order of
      the chain is determined by the order of calls to the
      "<code>AddSPU</code>" method. Here, the server node only has one SPU, so
      order is irrelevant.
    </p>
    <table border="0" width="100%" class="CodeFrame">
      <tr>
        <td width="7%" class="LineNumbers">
          30:<br>
          31:
        </td>
        <td width="93%" class="CodeListing">
          if (clientspuname == 'tilesort' ):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server_node.AddTile( 0, 0, 500, 500 )
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      If the client SPU is the <span class="SPU">tilesort</span> SPU (used for
      rendering to tiled displays), the tiling of the logical output space must
      be provided. This information is mandatory even if there is only one
      tile, since the absence of such a tile will make the server behave in
      slightly different ways (in particular, with respect to the <code class=
      "Function">glViewport</code> and <code class="Function">glScissor</code>
      calls). Notice that the tiling information is associated with the
      <em>server</em> node, not the <span class="SPU">render</span> SPU.
    </p>
    <table border="0" width="100%" class="CodeFrame">
      <tr>
        <td width="7%" class="LineNumbers">
          33:<br>
          34:<br>
          35:
        </td>
        <td width="93%" class="CodeListing">
          client_node = CRApplicationNode( )<br>
          client_node.AddSPU( client_spu )<br>
          client_spu.AddServer( server_node, 'tcpip' )
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Now that the server node has been completely defined, we define the
      client node. Notice that lines 33 and 34 are almost identical to lines 27
      and 28, except the client node is defined as an instance of a
      <code class="Class">CRApplicationNode</code> object. Line 30 adds the
      server node (defined on line 22) to the client SPU. Recall that the
      client SPU defaults to the <span class="SPU">pack</span> SPU, or the
      <span class="SPU">tilesort</span> SPU could be used instead. In fact, it
      is possible to make the client SPU the <span class="SPU">render</span>
      SPU, in which case the server is not needed. In such a case, calling
      <code class="Class">AddServer</code> won't hurt anything, so we always
      create a client-server relationship, regardless of the client SPU being
      used. This is in contrast to lines 30 and 31, where we don't want to
      define a tiling if we're not using a tiling-aware client SPU.
    </p>
    <table border="0" width="100%" class="CodeFrame">
      <tr>
        <td width="7%" class="LineNumbers">
          37:<br>
          38:
        </td>
        <td width="93%" class="CodeListing">
          client_node.SetApplication( '%s/%s' % (crbindir, demo) )<br>
          client_node.StartDir( crbindir )
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      So far, the node graph and SPU collection have been completely generic.
      Lines 37 and 38 bind a specific application to the client node. Line 37
      tells the application faker running on the client node which application
      to run. Line 38 tells the application faker to change directories to
      "<code>crbindir</code>" before launching the application. This is an
      optional step, but it is useful for applications that need to find
      certain input files, such as textures or application configuration
      information. If this line is omitted, the specified application will run
      in whatever directory <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span> was run from.
    </p>
    <table border="0" width="100%" class="CodeFrame">
      <tr>
        <td width="7%" class="LineNumbers">
          40:<br>
          41:<br>
          42:<br>

        </td>
        <td width="93%" class="CodeListing">
          cr = CR()<br>
          cr.MTU( 32*1024 );<br>

          cr.AddNode( server_node )<br>
          cr.Go()
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      The final 5 lines of the configuration script set everything in motion.
      Line 40 creates a <code class="Class">CR</code> object, which is the
      network-aware mothership that will respond to queries about the nodes it
      manages. On line 41 the <code class="Function">MTU</code> function
      sets the largest buffer size that is allowed to pass between a client and
      a server (in future versions of Chromium, this parameter may be specified
      in a different way). Lines 43 and 44 add the two nodes we have created to
      the mothership. Finally, the <code class="Function">Go</code> method is
      called, which will loop forever, answering configuration queries over the
      network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although this configuration script is quite simple, it exercises all of
      the features of the mothership scripting environment. An augmented
      version of this configuration file is available as <a href=
      "crdemo_full.conf" class="File">crdemo_full.conf</a>. This version adds
      two more SPUs, one at each node. These SPUs, called <span class=
      "SPU">print</span> SPUs, generate human-readable dumps of the OpenGL
      stream to log files for debugging or analysis. The reader should look at
      both <span class="File">crdemo_full.conf</span> and <span class=
      "File">crdemo.conf</span> and make sure that the differences are clear.
