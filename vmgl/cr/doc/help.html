    <p>
      There are four mailing lists, available from the <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=16529" target=
      "_parent">SourceForge project mailing list page</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href=
        "mailto:chromium-announce@lists.sourceforge.net"><b>chromium-announce</b></a>
        is for announcements relating to this project. It's very low-traffic,
        and everyone should subscribe to this mailing list for critical update
        notification, release announcements, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href=
        "mailto:chromium-users@lists.sourceforge.net"><b>chromium-users</b></a>
        is for users of the system who are not necessarily hacking on the code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href=
        "mailto:chromium-dev@lists.sourceforge.net"><b>chromium-dev</b></a> is
        a mailing list for people actively developing the system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href=
        "mailto:chromium-checkin@lists.sourceforge.net"><b>chromium-checkin</b></a>
        receives mail every time there is a change committed to the CVS
        repository, for those of you who want to stay on the very bleeding
        edge.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you encounter something that you think isn't working right, you should
      file a bug report on the <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=116529&amp;group_id=16529&amp;func=browse"
      target="_parent">SourceForge project bug tracking page</a>. Please browse
      the existing bugs first to make sure you're not submitting a duplicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't have a bug, but Chromium doesn't do something you think it
      ought to, you can submit a feature request on the <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=366529&amp;group_id=16529&amp;func=browse"
      target="_parent">SourceForge project feature request page</a>. Feature
      requests will (obviously) be lower priority than bugs, but they'll all be
      taken seriously. Of course, if you have a feature request, you could give
      thought to implementing it yourself if you have the resources. This is an
      open-source project, after all. Feature additions may be rolled into the
      main source tree on a case-by-case basis.
