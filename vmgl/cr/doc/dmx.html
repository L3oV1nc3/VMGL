      Using Chromium with DMX
    </h1>
    <p>
      <a href="http://dmx.sourceforge.net/" target="_parent">DMX</a> allows X
      to be run on a cluster of systems such that the X display/desktop can
      span many individual screens. For example, a cluster of 12 computers
      running X can be harnessed to provide a large tiled display of 4 x 3
      screens. Windows can span screen boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Needless to say, DMX works with X-based systems; not Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since version 1.2, Chromium has support for DMX so that OpenGL
      applications can work transparently on a DMX display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously, when Chromium's tilesort SPU was used to drive a large, tiled
      display there were a number of problems:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The original application window was created but left empty while
      Chromium rendered to the back-end screens.
      </li>
      <li>Mouse-based interaction was difficult because the pointer wasn't
      visible with the Chromium rendering.
      </li>
      <li>Only one OpenGL window was supported.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These problems are now fixed for DMX displays since Chromium directly
      renders into the real X windows. In short, OpenGL applications "just
      work" the way you'd expect.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Setup
    </h2>
    <p>
      You should already have DMX up and running on your graphics cluster. See
      the DMX documentation for instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, you'll need to copy the <span class="File">dmxext.h</span>
      header file from <span class=
      "File">dmx/xc/include/extensions/dmxext.h</span> into your usual X header
      file directory, such as <span class=
      "File">/usr/X11R6/include/X11/extensions</span>. Then, the DMX client
      library, <span class="File">libdmx.a</span> should be copied from
      <span class="File">dmx/build/xc/exports/lib/libdmx.a</span> to your usual
      X library directory, such as <span class=
      "Directory">/usr/X11R6/lib/</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll need to compile Chromium with DMX support. To do this, edit
      <span class="File">cr/options.mk</span> and set <code class=
      "BuildOption">USE_DMX=1</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, rebuild Chromium by doing <span class="Command">make clean</span>
      followed by <span class="Command">make</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If compilation fails, be sure the <span class="File">dmxext.h</span>
      header is in the right place (see above).
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Running Manually
    </h2>
    <p>
      Edit the sample <span class="File">mothership/config/dmx.conf</span>
      configuration script - you'll have to edit the TILE_ROWS, TILE_COLS and
      HOSTS settings, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start the mothership: <span class="Command">python dmx.conf
      appname</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      On each of the back-end systems:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>open a shell.
      </li>
      <li>set the <span class="EnvVar">DISPLAY</span> env var to the native X
      display (i.e. "cluster7:0")
      </li>
      <li>set the <span class="EnvVar">CRMOTHERSHIP</span> env var to the host
      where the mothership is running.
      </li>
      <li>set the <span class="EnvVar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span> env var to your
      Chromium lib directory
      </li>
      <li>start a <span class="CrApp">crserver</span>
      </li>
    </ul>On the DMX front-end system:
    <ul>
      <li>open a shell
      </li>
      <li>set the <span class="EnvVar">DISPLAY</span> env var to the DMX server
      (i.e. "frontend:1")
      </li>
      <li>set the <span class="EnvVar">CRMOTHERSHIP</span> env var to the host
      where the mothership is running.
      </li>
      <li>set the <span class="EnvVar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span> env var to your
      Chromium lib directory
      </li>
      <li>start a <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At this point, your OpenGL application should be running on DMX.
    </p>
    <p>
      If everything's working correctly you should see "GL_CR_dmx" in the list
      of OpenGL extensions listed by the <span class="Prog">glxinfo</span>
      program.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Running with Auto-start
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ideally, one would like to able to start an OpenGL application in the
      normal manner and have it use DMX+Chromium automatically, without
      manually starting a mothership and set of <span class=
      "CrApp">crservers</span> as we did above. The auto-start feature lets you
      do just that.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Prerequisites
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Your <span class="File">~/.crconfigs</span> file needs to be setup.
          Specifically, it needs a line like this:
        </p>
        <p class="Indent">
          * /usr/local/Chromium/cr/mothership/configs/autodmx.conf %m %p
        </p>
        <p>
          This tells Chromium's libcrfaker to use the <span class=
          "File">autodmx.conf</span> config file when running any application
          (indicated by *). The %m is replaced by a random mothership port. The
          %p is replaced by the program name.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span class="File">libGL.so</span> and <span class=
          "File">libGL.so.1</span> must be symlink to <span class=
          "File">libcrfaker.so</span>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The back-end/cluster machines must have the <span class=
          "CrApp">crserver</span> binary in the search path (typically
          <span class="Directory">/usr/local/bin</span> or <span class=
          "Directory">/usr/bin</span>) and a properly set <span class=
          "EnvVar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span> (you can tweak it below).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          rsh to the back-end/cluster machines must work.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You may need to tweak the value of 'crdir' in the <span class=
          "File">autodmx.conf</span> file.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
      How it works
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          When the app starts, libcrfaker will fail to find the mothership on
          its first try. That'll signal it to search the <span class=
          "File">.crconfigs</span> file for a mothership config to spawn.
          libcrfaker will choose a random port number for the mothership.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The mothership is spawned with <span class=
          "File">autodmx.conf</span>. In turn, it uses rsh to start up the
          <span class="CrApp">crservers</span> on the back-end machines.
          Another random port number is used for the <span class=
          "CrApp">crservers</span>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Control returns to libcrfaker where it proceeds to load the
          client-side SPU chain (<span class="SPU">tilesort</span>). Then,
          control returns to the application.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
      Troubleshooting autodmx.conf Problems
    </h3>
    <p>
      First, verify that <span class="File">libGL.so</span> and <span class=
      "File">libGL.so.1</span> resolve to <span class=
      "File">libcrfaker.so</span> by running <span class="Prog">ldd</span> on
      your application. Make sure your <span class="EnvVar">DISPLAY</span>
      environment variable is set to the DMX display.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make sure the back-end servers are properly configured:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure the options in <span class="File">dmx.conf</span> are set
      correctly then start the mothership with that configuration:
        <p class="Indent Command">
          python dmx.conf
        </p>
        <p>
          You should see something like this:
        </p>
        <p class="Indent Output">
          This is Chromium, Version 1.5<br>
          Start a crserver on cr1<br>
          Start a crserver on cr2<br>
          Start a crappfaker on foobar
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Manually start each of the <span class="CrApp">crservers</span> using
          rsh, for example:
        </p>
        <p class="Indent Command">
          rsh cr1 crserver
        </p>
        <p>
          If rsh complians about authorization or prompts for a password, edit
          the <span class="File">.rhosts</span> file on the servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you see "crserver: Command not found." it means that the
          <span class="CrApp">crserver</span> program is not in your search
          path. Edit the servers' <span class="File">.cshrc</span> or
          <span class="File">.bashrc</span> files and add <span class=
          "Directory">/usr/local/cr/bin/Linux</span> (or thereabouts) to your
          path variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you see "Couldn't connect to the mothership" it means the
          <span class="File">CRMOTHERSHIP</span> environment variable isn't
          getting set. Set it in the servers' <span class="File">.cshrc</span>
          or <span class="File">.bashrc</span> files to 'foobar'.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you get "crserver: error while loading shared libraries:
          libspuload.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
          directory" it means your <span class="EnvVar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>
          environment variable isn't set correctly. Again, edit the servers'
          <span class="File">.cshrc</span> or <span class="File">.bashrc</span>
          files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, the <span class="CrApp">crserver</span> should be running
          at that point. Start the remaining <span class=
          "CrApp">crservers</span>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Now you should be able to start the application and see it running on
      the DMX display.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now, exit your application and return to <span class=
      "File">autodmx.conf</span>. Simply running an OpenGL app should cause it
      to run on DMX. If not, read this section again or ask for help on the
      Chromium mailing lists.
    </p>
    <h3>
      NVIDIA Performance Tip
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you're using NVIDIA's OpenGL drivers and are experiencing poor
      performance on the DMX display it may be because you're using too much
      VRAM and falling back to software rendering. This inadvertantly happens
      because the render SPU may be creating GLX windows that are never used. A
      simple solution to this problem is to set the <span class=
      "SPU">render</span> SPU's default window size very small, say 2x2 pixels.
      See the <span class="File">dmx.conf</span> file for details.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      Configuration File Details
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <span class="File">dmx.conf</span> and <span class=
      "File">autodmx.conf</span> files are example configurations for using
      Chromium with DMX. If you decide to change them or make your own
      configuration file there are a few critical settings to be aware of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The client/application node must be configured to track window size and
      position changes:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      clientnode.Conf('track_window_size', 1)<br>
      clientnode.Conf('track_window_position', 1)
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="SPU">tilesort</span> SPU must be set to use DMX:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      tilesortspu.Conf('use_dmx', 1)
    </p>
    <p>
      The best bucketing mode to use is 'Non-Uniform Grid'. The 'Uniform Grid'
      mode can't be used since it's extremely rare for a window to be
      subdivided into identical tiles.
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      tilesortspu.Conf('bucket_mode', 'Non-Uniform Grid')
    </p>
    <p>
      The server/network node must be configured to use DMX. Optimized
      bucketing is of no use and should be disabled.
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      servernode.Conf('use_dmx', 1)<br>
      servernode.Conf('optimize_bucket', 0)
    </p>
    <p>
      The server's <span class="SPU">render</span> SPUs should be configured to
      render into the application window and the SPUs needs to know the
      appropriate X display for the back-end X servers:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      renderspu.Conf('render_to_app_window', 1)<br>
      renderspu.Conf('display_string', HOSTS[n] + ":0")
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      How Chromium Works with DMX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Each of the back-end systems runs a <span class="CrApp">crserver</span>.
      Each <span class="CrApp">crserver</span> has a <span class=
      "SPU">render</span> SPU.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mothership is configured for a crNetworkNode (<span class=
      "CrApp">crserver</span>) on each back-end server. A <span class=
      "SPU">tilesort</span> SPU is configured for the front-end application
      (<span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Chromium's libGL faker loads the <span class="SPU">tilesort</span> SPU.
      When a new OpenGL window is created, the <span class=
      "SPU">tilesort</span> SPU uses the DMX extension to find the window
      information on the back-end X servers which corresponds to the new X
      window. The <span class="SPU">tilesort</span> SPU directs the N back-end
      <span class="SPU">render</span> SPUs to directly draw into the back-end
      windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever the DMX OpenGL window is moved or resized the <span class=
      "SPU">tilesort</span> SPU recomputes a new tiling and sends that
      information to the backend <span class="CrApp">crservers</span>.
