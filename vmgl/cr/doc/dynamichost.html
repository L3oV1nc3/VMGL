<h1 class="PageHeading">Dynamic Host Matching</h1>

<p>
By default, hostnames are associated with nodes directly, when the node is
specified:</p>
<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">node = CRNetworkNode("hostname")</td></tr></table>

<p>
This arrangement is the easiest to create; but it can be difficult to manage if the
list of hosts participating in a Chromium session are not known when the <code>config</code>
script is written.</p>

<p>As a <code>config</code> script is a fully functional <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
script, it might be possible to use the full power of Python to make appropriate queries
and determine the host names when the <code>config</code> script is run; this is one way to
create a <em>dynamic</em> configuration that still appears to have well-defined <em>static</em>
hostnames as far as Chromium is concerned.</p>

<p>It is also possible to use true dynamic hosts within Chromium.  By using Chromium's own
dynamic host matching, Chromium can automatically associate connecting servers with
appropriate nodes, freeing the <code>config</code> file of the need to know all the
server host names in advance.</p>

<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Dynamic Host Syntax in Config Files</h2>

<p>
The syntax used to specify dynamic hosts is an extension of the syntax used
to specify "normal" static hosts (or rather, static host syntax is a special
case of the more general host syntax).  For example:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">node = CRNetworkNode("server1", "dynamic")</td></tr></table>

<p>can be used to specify a dynamic host called <code>server1</code>.  Note that
<code>server1</code> does <em>not</em> refer to a host named "server1"; it serves as
a variable, or placeholder.  When the mothership receives a connection from an appropriate
process (in this case, a <code>crserver</code> process), the dynamic host reference 
<code>server1</code> will be <em>resolved</em> to the name of whatever host connected
to the mothership.  From that point on, all dynamic nodes with a specified host identifier of
<code>"server1"</code> will behave as though they were static nodes specified with the
resolved hostname.</p>

<p>So if a second node were specified in the same way:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">node2 = CRNetworkNode("server1", "dynamic")</td></tr></table>

<p>
the same host name has been specified, so a second <code>crserver</code> must connect from
the same machine in order to be associated with the node.</p>

<p>More flexibly, if the second node were declared with a unique host identifier:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">node2 = CRNetworkNode("server2", "dynamic")</td></tr></table>

<p>then any connecting server host (including the same host that resolved <code>server1</code>)
could be associated with the node.  In other words, a single host identifier can only be
associated with a single host name; but the same host name may be associated with multiple
host identifiers, depending only on which servers connect to the mothership.</p>

<p>The easiest way, for example, to specify nodes in a <code>config</code> file that will
dynamically match to whatever <code>crserver</code> processes connect to the mothership
would be with something like:</p>
<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">for serverNumber in range(NUM_SERVERS):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;node = CRNetworkNode("server%d" % serverNumber, "dynamic")<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# configure the node, SPUs, etc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cr.AddNode(node)</td></tr></table>

<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Constraining Dynamic Matches</h2>

If you need more control over which servers are associated with which nodes,
you can use additional constraint tests.  In fact, all nodes have constraint
tests; the <code>"dynamic"</code> test is a special case of a constraint test
that matches any connecting host name.  And the default constraint test, used for static
node definitions, is called <code>"name"</code>; it matches any connecting host name
that represents the same host (i.e. has the same network address) as the corresponding 
host identifier.</p>

<p>In general, constraint tests take a corresponding constraint argument (although
the argument is not used for the <code>"dynamic"</code> and <code>"name</code>
tests).  Constraints are usually specified in the node constructor:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">node = CRNetworkNode(hostIdentifier, constraintTest, constraintArg)</td></tr></table>

<p>The following constraint tests are provided:</p>

<table width="100%" border="1">
    <tr class="GrayBackground">
	<th>Constraint Test</th>
	<th>Constraint Argument</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	<th>Example</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
	<td align="center"><code>name</code></td>
	<td align="center"><i>None</i></td>
	<td>Matches only connecting host names that represent the same host as the specified
	host identifier.</td>
	<td class="CodeListing">node = CRNetworkNode("mymachine")</td>
    </tr>

    <tr class="GrayBackground">
	<td align="center"><code>dynamic</code></td>
	<td align="center"><i>None</i></td>
	<td>Matches any connecting host name.</td>
	<td class="GrayCodeListing">node = CRNetworkNode("server1", "dynamic")</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
	<td align="center"><code>regex</code></td>
	<td align="center"><code>pattern_string</code></td>
	<td>Matches connecting host names that match the regular expression
	specified in <code>pattern_string</code>.
	<td class="CodeListing">node = CRNetworkNode("server1", "regex", "abc[0-9]*")</td>
    </tr>

    <tr class="GrayBackground">
	<td align="center"><code>pattern</code></td>
	<td align="center"><code>compiled_pattern</code></td>
	<td>Matches connecting host names that match the compiled regular
	expression specified in <code>compiled_pattern</code>.
	<td class="GrayCodeListing">pattern = re.compile("abc[0-9]*")<br>
	node = CRNetworkNode("server1", "pattern", pattern)</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
	<td align="center"><code>regex_full</code></td>
	<td align="center"><code>pattern_string</code></td>
	<td>Matches connecting host names whose fully qualified domain names
	match the regular expression specified in <code>pattern_string</code>.
	<td class="CodeListing">node = CRNetworkNode("server1", "regex", ".*\.psc\.edu")</td>
    </tr>

    <tr class="GrayBackground">
	<td align="center"><code>pattern_full</code></td>
	<td align="center"><code>compiled_pattern</code></td>
	<td>Matches connecting host names whose fully qualified domain names
	match the compiled regular expression specified in <code>compiled_pattern</code>.
	<td class="GrayCodeListing">pattern = re.compile(".*\.psc\.edu")<br>
	node = CRNetworkNode("server1", "pattern_full", pattern)</td>
    </tr>

</table>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Multiple Constraints</h2>

<p>All nodes have at least one constraint associated with them.  It is
possible for nodes to have additional constraints added, with the
<code>AddConstraint(constraintTest, constraintArg)</code> node method:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">node = CRNetworkNode("server1", "regex", "abc[0-9]*")<br>
node.AddConstraint("regex_full", ".*\.psc\.edu")</td></tr></table>
