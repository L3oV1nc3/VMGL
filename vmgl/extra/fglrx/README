fglrx kernel module for ATI GPU's, enabled for dom0. VMGL project. 
Licence notice below.
Known to work with a Radeon X600 (PCI Express)
Based on versions
	- fglrx = 8.26.8
	- xen = unstable - pre 3.0.3

IMPORTANT: SourceForge does not allow non open-source software. I have thus removed the
file libfglrx_ip.a.GCC4 from fglrx_module. You must provide yourself this file by 
downloading it from ATI

First:
- Copy the fglrx_module tree somewhere fancy, 
or
- Patch the kernel module open source wrapper in your fglrx tree with 
  fglrx_module.patch. This tree is tipically in
  fglrx-install/common/lib/modules/fglrx/build_mod
  after unpacking ati-driver-installer-<version>.sh. Use patch -p1.
	
Build:
- In fglrx_module directory just type "make". You can override KERNEL_PATH.
or
- If you patched your fglrx tree, be brave and rebuild it...

Enjoy
